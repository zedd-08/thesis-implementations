### Section 5

(game : BG1)

Mercenaries were petrified while trying to break into the home of Ramazith: Ramazith sold the mercenaries to an art collector. Degrodel gives the player six scrolls of stone to flesh to unpetrify the mercenaries. One of the mercenaries has the Helm of Balduran

***Degrodel:** "First of all, my name is Degrodel. I have been on the lookout for skilled adventurers. My task is very simple.
Some years ago, an evil band of mercenaries were all petrified while trying to break into the home of Ramazith. For those of you with a limited vocabulary, petrified means "turned to stone." Anyhow, one of those adventurers had in his possession an item of power: the Helm of Balduran. Ramazith didn't know this at the time and so, after turning them all to stone, he simply sold their bodies to an art collector living in the heart of Baldur's Gate.
What I would like you to do is find these statues, turn them back to flesh, and take the item. I will give you these six scrolls of stone to flesh. Use them on the statues when you find them.
The estate can be found just west of the fairgrounds in the center of town. Good luck, and don't entertain any thoughts about betraying me. It could be very hazardous to your health.
You will be paid 5,000 gold for this service. This is a kingly sum, so I won't barter with you about the amount."*

Korgan Bloodaxe and his fellows were on a mission to obtain the Book of Kaza for a book collector. Korgan Bloodaxe and his fellows had a heated argument: only Korgan Bloodaxe remained alive afterwards.

***Korgan Bloodaxe:** "I'm scouring for a band of desperate adventurers to aid me in a gallant task. Come and hear Korgan Bloodaxe's tale!
A fortnight past, me fellows and I were in the midst of obtaining an ancient text fer our patron when a skirmish visited our midst. Vile words, alas, became a lake of bloodshed. So it goes the sacred grimoire ne'er made it to our benefactor's hand. And now he awaits its arrival with a zeal reserved for a grog-blossom in an alekeg. The scuttlebutt is the pay is handsome and worthy of note â€” sacks of loot and odd magics. The volume sits not far from 'ere, and the bibliomaniac, he paces the floor in the meantime. 'Tis called the Book of Kaza.
The Book of Kaza is in some hobnail's tomb over in the lower crypts of the Graveyard District. It's nae abandoned, but rumors and half-truths only scare the young and infirm. Keeps the curious away, me guess.
Well... it'll take far more than a few shambling bags of skin and stitches to deter Korgan Bloodaxe from a king's ransom! A foolhardy jaunt into a hive of undead? How could ye resist?"*

Those foul vermin... the abominations we call ash spawn have risen from the ashes of our own ancestors. They're befouling the memories of our forefathers by defiling their remains.

### Section 10

(game : TESO)

Martin needs the blood of a Divine for the ritual to open the portal to Camoran's Paradise in addition to the first item, the blood of a Daedra.

***Martin:** "I've figured out another item needed for the ritual to open the portal to Camoran's Paradise. The second item is the counterpart to the first: the blood of a Divine.
This was a terrible puzzle to me. Unlike the Daedra, the gods have no artifacts, and do not physically manifest themselves in our world.
How then to obtain the blood of a god? But Jauffre solved it. The blood of Tiber Septim himself, who became one of the Divines. This is a secret remembered only by the Blades, passed down from one Grandmaster to the next.
Jauffre should tell it to you himself."*
