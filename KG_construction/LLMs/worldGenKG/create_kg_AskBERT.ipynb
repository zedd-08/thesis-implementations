    "doc = \"After escaping the confines of the Great Plateau, Link is directed to meet the wise Sheikah elder Impa, and learn about the Guardians and Divine Beasts: 10,000 years prior the Guardians and Divine Beasts were created and successfully used by another Hero and another Princess to defeat a great evil known as the Calamity Ganon. But throughout the ages, knowledge about the Guardians and Divine Beasts was lost until excavations in the ruined country of Hyrule Kingdom brought the Guardians and Divine Beasts to light once more, coinciding with the expected return of a great evil known as the Calamity Ganon a hundred years ago. Guardians were reactivated and four Champions were chosen to control Divine Beasts: the Zora princess Mipha, the Goron warrior Daruk, the Gerudo chief Urbosa, and the Rito archer Revali. All the while, Zelda, who is the daughter of King Rhoam was unsuccessfully trying to gain access to Zelda, who is the daughter of King Rhoam's own prophesied powers, accompanied on Zelda, who is the daughter of King Rhoam's quests by Zelda, who is the daughter of King Rhoam's knight, the Hylian Champion Link. When a great evil known as the Calamity Ganon ultimately attacked, a great evil known as the Calamity Ganon devastated the ruined country of Hyrule Kingdom by taking control of the ancient machines and turning the ancient machines against the Hyruleans. As a last resort, Zelda, who is the daughter of King Rhoam was able to place Link in the Shrine of Resurrection and use Zelda, who is the daughter of King Rhoam's awoken sealing powers to trap Zelda, who is the daughter of King Rhoam with a great evil known as the Calamity Ganon in Hyrule Castle.\""

      "A lonely couple, who want a child, live next to a walled garden belonging to a sorceress. The wife, experiencing the cravings associated with the arrival of her long-awaited pregnancy, notices some rapunzel, growing in the garden and longs for it. She refuses to eat anything else and gets sick, and the husband begins to fear for her life. One night, her husband breaks into the garden to get some for her. She makes a salad out of it and greedily eats it. It tastes so good that she longs for more. So her husband goes to get some more for her. As he scales the wall to return home, the sorceress catches him and accuses him of theft. He begs for mercy, and she agrees to be lenient, and allows him to take all the rapunzel he wants, on condition that the baby be given to her when it's born. Desperate, he agrees. When his wife has a baby girl, the sorceress takes her to raise as her own and names her \"Rapunzel\" after the plant her mother craved. She grows up to be the most beautiful child in the world, with long golden hair. When she turns twelve, the sorceress locks her up inside a tower in the middle of the woods, with neither stairs nor a door, and only one room and one window. In order to visit Rapunzel, the sorceress stands beneath the tower and calls out:\n",
      "\n",
      "    Rapunzel!\n",
      "    Rapunzel!\n",
      "    Let down your hair\n",
      "    That I may climb thy golden stair!\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, a prince rides through the forest and hears Rapunzel singing from the tower. Entranced by her ethereal voice, he searches for her and discovers the tower, but is naturally unable to enter it. He returns often, listening to her beautiful singing, and one day sees the sorceress visit, and thus learns how to gain access to Rapunzel. When the sorceress leaves, he bids Rapunzel let her hair down. When she does so, he climbs up and they fall in love. He eventually asks her to marry him, which she agrees to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together they plan a means of escape, wherein he will come each night, and bring Rapunzel a piece of silk, which she will gradually weave into a ladder. Before the plan can come to fruition, however, she foolishly gives him away. In the first edition of Kinder- und Hausmärchen, she innocently says that her dress is growing tighter around her waist; in later editions, she asks \"Dame Gothel\" why it is easier for her to draw up the prince than her. In anger, she cuts off a majority of Rapunzel's hair and casts her out into the wilderness to fend for herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the prince calls that night, the sorceress lets the severed hair down to haul him up. To his horror, he finds himself meeting her instead of Rapunzel, who is nowhere to be found. After she tells him in a rage that he will never see Rapunzel again, he leaps or falls from the tower, landing in a thorn bush. Although the thorn bush breaks his fall and saves his life, it scratches his eyes and blinds him.\n",
      "\n",
      "For years, he wanders through the wastelands of the country and eventually comes to the wilderness where Rapunzel now lives with the twins to whom she has given birth, a boy and a girl. One day, as she sings, he hears her voice again, and they are reunited. When they fall into each other's arms, her tears immediately restore his sight. He leads her and their twins to his kingdom, where they live happily ever after.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some versions of the story, Rapunzel's hair magically grows back after the prince touches it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another version of the story ends with the revelation that her foster mother had untied Rapunzel's hair after the prince leapt from the tower, and it slipped from her hands and landed far below, leaving her trapped in the tower.\n",
