This barbarian, Havilstein Hoar-Blood by name, savagely butchered the chieftain of a mead hall on the island of Solstheim. The chieftain's sister has forgone the Nord custom of extracting the monetary retribution of wergild, and instead wants Hoar-Blood to pay with his life. You, dear Silencer, will help put her family at peace.\nYou are to go to Gnoll Mountain, locate Havilstein Hoar-Blood, and send his soul to the great beyond.\nWhen Hoar-Blood has been executed, journey to the ancient ruin of Nornal. In the flooded section of that ruin you will find a chest, submerged in the water. As you may have guessed, the chest contains your reward for killing Havilstein Hoar-Blood, 500 gold, and your next contract."

I told him to stop, but he didn't listen. He was certain he could win us a fortune and move us somewhere nicer, like the Imperial City. It didn't take long for Aleron to begin losing. He resorted to borrowing money from a usurer to cover his losses and place new bets. As you can imagine, it didn't pay off. He ended up owing around 500 gold. We could never have that kind of money to pay back the usurer.\nYesterday, the usurer, Kurdan gro-Dragol, sent for my husband to meet him at the Lonely Suitor Lodge. He hasn't returned since. I fear for his life. Kurdan isn't known for his patience. Please, I'm not wealthy, but I'd give anything to see Aleron again. Please, find Aleron.\nFarewell, and be careful, Kurdan is not to be trusted."

Some dastardly Grummites stole my most prized possession... my medallion that signified my membership in the Knights. It's a small, round, gold medallion. On the back is the inscription \"To Pyke, from Farwil\".\nCould you bring back my medallion from the Grummites at Fetid Grove? I will mark Fetid Grove on your map.

A disturbing vision. \"The shade of Sir Berich spoke to me,\" was all he said. \"We must put him to rest.\" He said that Sir Berich's tomb was in Underpall Cave -- which is no cave, but some kind of buried keep.\nHe had learned that Sir Berich had once been a questing knight, like us. He had found the Greaves and Sword of the Crusader, but then turned to evil. Sir Roderic hoped to find the Relics within Sir Berich's tomb. And he did. But we also found a terrible guardian -- the wraith of Sir Berich.\nI brought you... Sir Roderic shouted for me to take them... the Greaves of the Crusader. The holy Relic. They're yours. The wraith used the Sword of the Crusader against Sir Roderic. I don't know how that evil thing could use the holy weapon, but it did.\nYou must avenge Sir Roderic by killing the foul wraith and get yourself the Sword of the Crusader!"

I never saw our work finished; I trust that the others carried on without me.\nThe fort lies in the southeast of Cyrodiil, near the Black Marsh border. If all went according to plan, it should be very well guarded now."

I am sorry to be so forward, but I desperately need your help. It seems that my husband, Rythe, has gone missing, and I just don't know what to do.\nRythe is known far and wide as one of the best painters in all Cyrodiil. His specialty is setting the Great Forest to canvas. The paintings look so amazingly real that some say they can see the trees sway in the breeze. That's a silly notion of course, but it just goes to show the attention to detail Rythe uses when he paints.\nRythe likes to work in his studio with the door locked, so no one can disturb him. He usually comes out to eat dinner and sleep, but two days ago, he didn't come out at all. At first, I wasn't worried. He does that occasionally. But when he didn't come out for a full day, I unlocked the studio with the key he said to use only in emergencies. It turned out he wasn't inside! I'm sure he never left that room. So I have no idea where he's gone.\nPlease. Help me find Rythe. I love him dearly, and I am so worried. Here's the key to Rythe's studio. You may come and go as you please. If you need me, I'll be around the house."

And now, I must ask you to press forward where I could not. I must ask you to face the challenge of Zenithar.\nI was arrogant and foolhardy. I sought personal glory. I placed my own will and my own lust for fame over the will of the Nine. In facing the challenge of Zenithar, I failed. I tried dozens -- no, hundreds of times to reach the Mace. I fell each time. And each time I awoke in the chapel, I leaped again. I tried to enlist the help of the other knights, but none would come to my aid. The inscription says to \"walk in the faith\" but even now, I do not know what this means.\nBelow the Chapel of Zenithar in Leyawiin there is a shrine to the great craftsman, Saint Kaladas. Those seeking the Mace must pray before the shrine. When you bow, you will receive a vision -- or perhaps not. It is unclear. The priests saw that my body never moved, but it felt so real. You will see the Mace of Zenithar, separated from you by a great chasm. The chasm represents your doubt. Your faith must be your guide across it.\nThis is what I know. As I said, my faith was weak. I did not understand the test and I fell from the platform each time I tried to cross. I have told you all that I know. All that is left is for you to prove yourself more worthy than I. If you seek the Mace, travel to Leyawiin's chapel, kneel at the shrine in the undercroft, and let your faith in the Nine be the salvation of us all."

You can imagine how difficult it is to run an inn while invisible. Once you get a reputation as a haunted inn, you can just forget about it. So we've all been keeping quiet, hoping the spell will wear off. But we're running out of patience. We're sure it was Ancotar's doing, but we can't find him. If you can help us, we will be extremely grateful.\nAncotar's a wizard who took up residence in the ruins of Fort Caractacus a couple of years ago. He's caused us no end of trouble with his magical experiments, but nothing as bad as this. We've tried to find him, but had no luck. If he's still living in the fort, he's hiding from us, and no wonder. If you could find him and get him to remove this cursed invisibility, we will all be in your debt. The ruined fort is just to the southeast of here. Follow the path down the hill. But watch out for the invisible monsters that infest the ruins!\nIf you make us visible again, you'd be welcome at the Aleswell Inn anytime. Free of charge."

I can't let people know I have scamps in here, or they'll think I've taken to Daedra worship. Try explaining that to the town guard.\nI had a feeling buying that Daedric Staff would be trouble. Now I'm paying for it with more than just some gold. A few weeks ago, a spellsword was passing through Leyawiin and heard that I like to buy curiosities. He wanted to sell the staff you see me carrying. I eagerly bought it, knowing the value of Daedric relics. In fact, I was a bit suspicious when he sold it so cheap. His loss, my gain I figured. After examining it for a bit I noticed a small word carved on it in runes. Using a book from my library, I translated it. The word was nonsense. However, when I spoke it and held the staff, four scamps suddenly appeared! I thought I was done for! Strangely, they all just stood there. It didn't take long before I realized they were following me! I couldn't be seen in town with scamps following, so I decided to discard the staff. I can't explain it, but somehow I can't compel myself to actually let it go. This staff is obviously cursed! Now I'm stuck with it.\nOh please, I beg you! Take this staff to Darkfathom Cave and get rid of it and the scamps forever! I can't fight, and who knows what's guarding the shrine? Plus, do you know how dirty caves are? It'll ruin anything I wear!\nDo this for me, and I'll reward you with another one of my curios I picked up a few years ago... a valuable ring. Ring of Eidolon's Edge."

At our wedding, my father gave us a family heirloom as a gift; Rockshatter, a mace that's been in my family for many generations.\nBjalfi snatched Rockshatter from our mantle and took off to \"find his fortune\" with the local Marauder gang at Fort Strand. I want that mace back. Please, I don't think he's ever coming back, and I'd hate to lose such a precious heirloom to a gang of thugs."

If you find him or the rest of the Knights of the Thorn, get them out of there. I'm sure that the Count would also be pleased if the gate was closed.\nThe Knights of the Thorn are a bunch of rabble who fancy themselves true knights. Farwil formed the group around two years ago. They make grand boasts, and talk a good talk, but that's all they are. The real work goes to us, the City Guard. I hate to speak ill of them, as something horrible may have happened, but their own bravado got them into this mess."

We formed this group a while back to keep a nice fair economic balance in town. Not every store is a member, but we're slowly trying to convince them to join. Everything was fine until Thoronir opened his shop nearby.\nSelling all sorts of merchandise, Thoronir undercuts prices like you wouldn't believe. He doesn't always sell what we sell, but it is still a problem. People who buy tend to want to spend their money there. That leaves none for us. It's getting so bad, a few of us may have to close up shop. He outright refuses to join the Society or even discuss the matter. We are convinced he is up to no good.\nWhat we need is for you to case his establishment, and figure out where he gets his inventory. Find some proof of his wrongdoing, and let us know. We cannot do it ourselves, as he recognizes all of us. The job pays a fair bounty in gold when he is brought to justice."

This is fortunate, as I also seek the cure.\nI wish to tell you a story so that you might understand why I would trust you with my secrets. More than 50 years ago, my wife Rona and I were both turned into vampires. While I came to embrace the changes in myself, she did not. She hated what she had become, and refused to feed to keep herself healthy. She eventually slipped into a coma from which she has not awoken. My trusted servants have cared for her all this time, but I wish for her to at last find peace. The cure is for her. I have researched what I can, but acquiring the cure is beyond my grasp. I cannot risk drawing too much attention to myself. So I would ask that you took up the search on my behalf. If you are successful, I will reward you in whatever small way I can. Will you aid me?\nWhat little I have discovered points to the witches of Glenmoril. In the past, they have been capable of creating a cure. I have searched for these witches throughout Cyrodiil, but no covens still exist within its borders. There may be one left. I have unconfirmed reports of a woman seen near the Corbolo river, who fits the description of these witches. Seek her out, and learn whether she can help. She lives somewhere along the river, east of the Imperial City and south of Cheydinhal. If you are successful in finding a cure, report to my steward. You have my thanks."

            "description": "I, Sir Casimir, know where you may find the Gauntlets of the Crusader, for I was the one who lost them when I was still alive. Though many know where they are, they are still lost. I believe there is something you must do in order to retrieve them.\nWhen the Order fractured, I followed Sir Berich into war, taking the Gauntlets with me. When it was over, I returned to this land. I attempted to return to the service of the Nine, but the war had changed me. I no longer had sympathy for the weak, or pity for the suffering. In the brief time I was there, I did more to hurt the Chapel of Stendarr than help it. It was there that I was cursed.\nA beggar who came to the Chapel each day for help tried my patience one too many times. I lost my temper, and struck him. My blow landed harder than I had intended, and he fell to the floor, dead. Killed in the very Chapel of the God of Mercy. I left the Chapel at once, of course, but the damage was done. I was weak, constantly weary, and lacked the energy to do almost anything.\nAs proof of the deed, when I struck the poor man the Gauntlets slipped right off my hands and fell to the floor. Heavy as stone, they would not move. None could lift them. I suspect they lie there still, in Chorrol's Chapel. You must prove to Stendarr you are worthy to lift the Gauntlets once more. Seek out the priests of Stendarr in Chorrol. Perhaps they can help you."

However, the secrets of its construction are lost.\nThat which is lost can be found again. There is one being in the Shivering Isles who may be able to assist you in the construction of a new Staff.

Either we Demented or those blasted Manics. It's the only way we'll find any peace. You get rid of those Manics. All of them. If you can take care of that for me, I'd make it worth your while.."

I wouldn't say we're thieves. I mean, we've stolen things... sure. But we've never stolen that much at one time. Just enough to keep us going. That is, until last year.\nJorundr started to take risks and began robbing more dangerous targets. Not just lone merchants, mind you. I'm talking about the bigger scores. Like estates and tax shipments. I begged him to stop, as I knew that his capers would one day lead to violence. He just threatened to... hurt me if I got in his way. I think the gold changed him. I really do. He wasn't the man I met seven years ago. The few times I tried to say something, he'd strike me or push me away. I began to become frightened of him.\nOur last score was a tax shipment being delivered to the Imperial City. We robbed it, and in the midst of the chaos, Jorundr killed a guard. I was mortified. We snatched up the gold and holed up in the mountains. He said if I breathed a word of the murder to anyone, he'd kill me. I was terrified of him at this point. Two days later, the Bruma City Guard traced us to our makeshift campsite. I was off gathering food, but Jorundr was captured. Served him right. When I went back to the site later, the gold was gone! He'd moved it! What I need you to do is go to the Bruma Castle Dungeons and speak to him for me. Convince him to tell you where the gold is and then we split it."

We are going to steal one of the Elder Scrolls from the Imperial Palace. Are you ready for this challenge?\nThere is no buyer. This is for glory, not for money. Our names will become legend. I also have a personal need for this particular scroll. As for your compensation, I ask you to trust me. If my plan works, you will get a reward worth far more than mere money.\nI have worked for eleven years planning this heist. Savilla's Stone provided the last bit of information I needed. The Elder Scrolls are kept in the Imperial Palace behind a door that cannot be breached. Savilla's Stone has revealed a path around this door. You will have to travel the Old Way. Once used as an escape route for Imperial Emperors, it has been forgotten for centuries.\nThe Old Way can be found in the Imperial Sewers. Here is the key for the gate to that section of the sewers. My scrying with Savilla's Stone has provided clues, but not the details. I know the tools you will need there, but not the obstacles themselves. The Boots of Springheel Jak will allow you to leap to an unreachable place. They will also protect you from a long fall. The Arrow of Extrication is the only way to unlock the final door. Take them both.\nOnce you are inside the Palace itself, you need to find the reading room. The blind priests will deliver a scroll to you there. I arranged for the notable Celia Camoran to want to read a particular Elder Scroll. Don't ask how. However, she will be... unavoidably detained. You will take her place. Do not speak to the priests. They are blindfolded and will not realize it isn't her unless you speak. As the guildmaster, I am waiving bloodprice for anyone you kill during this heist. However, I can't stop the Watch from putting a price on your head.\nI have written it all down for you in this book. I've chosen you because you are the best. Good luck."

It is a most delicate matter.\nLady Umbranox of Anvil, is hunting for a new captain of her guard. The Legion Commander of the Imperial Watch sent her a list of candidates. The Gray Fox wants this list replaced with one that highly recommends Hieronymus Lex. From Anvil he can do little harm to the guild. The letter carrying the list is currently in steward Dairihill's desk. She has lied to Lady Umbranox, telling her that the letter has yet to arrive.\nFor reasons unknown to this one, the Gray Fox has extended his protection to the Umbranox family and Lady Umbranox in particular. While Lex is a problem for the guild, his unwavering loyalty and resolve make him the perfect protector for Lady Umbranox.\nYou will have to track down a forger on your own. I don't know of any in Bravil. With the forged letter in hand, sneak into the Legion Commander's office in the Imperial City Prison and seal it with his seal. Dairihill cannot be trusted. You must deliver the letter to Lady Umbranox in person.\nRemember, this is a mission of stealth, not blood. Your payment will be higher than normal to cover the expense of the forgery."

They didn't listen to my voice. Now, they are all paying the cost of ignorance. The Sunken One strikes swift and hard. He swats those who oppose Him as if they did not exist at all. The excuses of man fall upon deaf ears. The Sunken One has no pity; He has no mercy, He only sits below and passes sentence. And now, with a mighty stroke, He's toppled one of man's pitiful blights on His land. And yet, He still hungers. His appetite is voracious. Kvatch will not be the last city to fall by His hand. The world of man grows more and more corrupt, and it angers Him. Man's lies and deceit will be his undoing as The Sunken One grows impatient and no longer waits for or accepts the proper offering.\nThe burden is mine to shoulder. I am the last who knows of He Who Shakes The Ground. If I do not bring him the Offering, who knows what city may fall prey to his whim? Anvil? Chorrol? Or perhaps He will turn his eyes on the greatest boil of all, the great Imperial City itself. No, I must not let that happen. I must get the Offering to him like my father did before me. Man may be fallen in His eyes, but they must have time to learn The Sunken One's teachings. Destroying man now would be a waste, when I am certain that given the chance, they will come to see His ways. Yes, I will do this thing. I will brave the depths of Sandstone Cavern to see Him. My weapons will be my will and my word. The Sunken One will watch over me and guide me. I must depart soon, before it is too late. If anyone finds this journal, let them know that I, Slythe Seringi, do this for the good of all man."

Do not kill him! You see, Francois Motierre is a marked man. He owes a considerable sum to the wrong kind of people. So, they have sent an enforcer to kill him.

I confess I have a weakness for crystals of a magical nature, and I must add these to my collection. This is a personal errand, you must understand. Just between you and I. The Mages Guild has nothing to do with it.\nThe Tears are not just a namesake. They're literally the frozen tears of a knight named Garridan Stalrous who lived many years ago. I'm not certain what happened to the knight, or why the tears were frozen, but I do know someone you could ask. Seek out Julienne Fanis at the Arcane University in the Imperial City. She oversees the Alchemy Headquarters there. If anyone can help you get more information on about these crystals, she can."

To think he'd fall for the gang's scheme... agh! I could kill him! I'm sorry... I'm rambling and got you confused. Let me explain.\nThe women in the gang use their wiles to lure men out to some remote location and rob them blind. It's been going on for some time now. The city guard hasn't done very much about it, because frankly, the men who are robbed are so embarrassed, they don't want to report it. Take for example that good-for-nothing husband of mine, Gogan. He cared more about their charms than my own.\nWhen Gogan was, uh... with the women, they took something quite valuable from him. No... it's not what you're thinking. He was carrying a precious family heirloom with him when he was lured out to their lair. It was a small ring given to him on our wedding day. The ring belonged to my mother, and has been in the family for generations. I'm willing to give you all the money I have to get it back. 100 gold. Can you help us?\nAll I can tell you is that the best place to start is at The Flowing Bowl. It's a tavern located outside the city walls near the waterfront. The Flowing Bowl attracts the worst Anvil has to offer. Always be on your guard."

However, their father, the original owner of Weatherleah left them an even greater legacy.\nMy tale actually begins with the father, Albert Jemane. He was once in my employ, or should I say the employ of my organization. He was very good at obtaining things from people who did not want to part with. A professional thief, to put it bluntly. He was assigned to obtain a very valuable item for me. He succeeded, but decided to keep this item for himself. An unfortunate decision.\nAlbert Jemane fled from Chorrol with his family, and was never heard from again. Only his small son Reynald was found, wandering alone in the wilderness. Naturally, my associates and I believed he had perished. The wilderness is, after all, a dangerous place. No place to take your family. Then, these many years later, voila! The brother reappears. It seems the rest of the family did not die in the wilderness after all.\nWhat is the point of my tale? Albert Jemane builds Weatherleah way out in the middle of nowhere. He was a thief, not a farmer. The only reason to establish such a place would be to stay out of the Chorrol Guard's sight. I believe that the item Albert stole, which rightly belongs to me, was hidden at Weatherleah. Unfortunately, the notorious Redguard Valley Ogres ransacked the place and probably took all of the loot back with them.\nIf you were to obtain this item, somehow, and bring it to me, I would pay you very well for it."

He's treacherous and only wants you to get to the treasure. I didn't give it up to the guards, and I won't give it up to Delgariun. I've hidden the treasure within the walls of Rosethorn Hall. Remember the toy we played with as we ran through this place as children?\nRemember the riddle we had for it? It was our secret code: \"Two bodies have I, though both joined in one. The more I stand still, the quicker I run.\"\nThe key to the treasure lies with the answer. Take care of it, my love. It is your ticket far from Delgariun.

Since you already know what they look like, do you feel up to a bit of a collecting expedition?\nA few years ago, an adventurer not unlike yourself sold me a musty old tome containing alchemical formulas. Most of them were worthless. But one of the moldy pages contained the recipe for a potion known as an Elixir of Exploration, a sort of \"ultimate dungeon delver's\" brew. The formula looked sound, except it required an extremely rare ingredient. Yes, you guessed it, the Nirnroot. I put the book aside, because frankly, I had so many other delicate experiments going on that I just didn't have the time to go plant hunting. Now that you're here, that changes things.\nThe Elixir of Exploration is a multi-purpose potion that was obviously created with the dungeon explorer in mind. The formula describes many magnitudes of the brew. If you're interested, I wrote a short missive about it for the Imperial Alchemy Symposium. You bring me 10 samples of Nirnroot, and I'll make the Elixir of Exploration available to you at a huge discount as well as give you one for free.\nThe best place for you to start would be Shadeleaf Copse, which is a part of the Great Forest northeast of here. Good luck, and hurry back with more of the Nirnroot!"

Hmm, could you, in fact, imagine just how long I've been waiting? I don't think you could, but I might be wrong.\nIt felt like rather a long time, but then long times get longer when you're standing around thinking about them. A curious thing, that. Long roads get longer too, if you're thinking about them, but what about long words? They don't change nearly as much. Long, short -- it all ends up the same. Dust and tears. Usually tears first, then the dust. Dust can't cry, you see. That would be... well, amusing. You know what's NOT amusing? I don't have my Chalice of Reversal. It makes me sad. When I get sad, I don't care to do much of anything. I certainly don't care to help people who show up on my doorstep wanting something. Are we getting the picture here?\nThe Chalice of Reversal is one of my favorite toys. Does wonders for creativity. Well, not by itself, but it helps. Is this making sense? Look, you eat the Felldew, then use the chalice, and find the world a much brighter and happier place. Honest. But I don't have it. So I can't eat Felldew, because that would just be bad. I mean, really bad. Find my chalice!"

We tried to eliminate Phillida, of course, but failed on three separate occasions. He's a powerful man, and was surrounded by powerful associates. Now the Legion's pig's years of service have come to an end. He has retired. Phillida must not be allowed such a victory! His destiny is... darker. Phillida now resides in Leyawiin, in the City Watch barracks, an honored guest of the soldiers there. He is, in fact, more vulnerable than ever.\nThe Black Hand has sanctioned the Rose of Sithis. It is a magic arrow specifically enchanted to kill its target. In this case, Phillida. As long as the arrow hits Phillida, he will die. But it cannot pierce armor! Shoot while Phillida is armored, and the Rose will be wasted. Travel to Leyawiin. Track Phillida. Learn his schedule. Observe when he removes that blasted Legion armor! And then, let fly the Rose of Sithis! Kill Phillida in any way, Rose or not, and the contract is complete. But to receive a bonus, you must go beyond murder. You must send a message! Once Phillida is dead, take the very finger from his corpse, the one that bears an Imperial Legion signet ring! Deposit this finger in the desk of Phillida's successor, in his office in the Prison Barracks, in the Imperial City! Do this, and the bonus is yours."

My name is Agronak gro-Malog.\nI grew up here in the Imperial City, but I was born elsewhere. My mother was a servant in the employ of Lord Lovidicus, and resided at his fortress. Lady Lovidicus was a shrew of a woman. The Lord and my mother grew close, and ultimately fell in love. I was the result of their union. When the Lady learned of my birth she was furious, and threatened to kill both my mother and me. So we fled, leaving my claim to nobility behind.\nMy mother died recently. Before she passed, she gave me this key, and told me it would \"unlock the truth,\" at the place of my birth, Crowhaven. Crowhaven is a ruined fort far to the west of here. I'd go myself, but my training regiment doesn't allow for the luxury of such an excursion.\nMy friend, you must travel to Crowhaven and use the key to unlock whatever it is that holds the proof of my birthright! Find this proof and return it to me, and I'll share with you some of my finest combat techniques. Trust me, you can't learn these moves in a book!"

The Black Hand has learned that the Dark Brotherhood has been infiltrated. By whom, and for what purpose, we do not yet know. What we do know is that there is some link between the traitor and the Cheydinhal Sanctuary. The traitor has tainted that place beyond repair. It was learned that the traitor has been active for quite some time, since before you joined the Brotherhood. That absolves you of any suspicion.\nThe Black Hand has chosen you to perform the ancient rite known as Purification. Everyone inside the Sanctuary must die! You must break one of the Tenets you have sworn to uphold. I know this is an unexpected turn of events, but drastic measures must be taken. Ocheeva, Vicente Valtieri, Antoinetta Marie, Gogron gro-Bolmog, Telaendril, M'raaj-Dar and Teinaava. All of these family members must die! From this point forward, you are no longer bound by the Five Tenets! Sithis will forgive any murder, any theft, so long as you serve the Black Hand!\nWhen the rite of Purification has been completed, return to me here at Fort Farragut, and we will discuss your future. Now, take these special gifts. They will help you greatly. One is a poisoned apple. The other, a unique scroll of summoning. Good luck... assassin."

I am Seridur.\nWelcome. You're now in the sanctuary of the Order of the Virtuous Blood. Few outside our circle have ever set foot in our hallowed hall. We are, for lack of a better word, defenders. We guard this city from an infestation that plagues it. We are vampire hunters. I'm sure you are familiar with those despicable beings. Feeding on the innocent as if they were cattle. Well, this group was formed to combat them. Alas, we are but 3 old men, not able to match the fighting prowess of the vampire. We lack the strength to defeat them in battle.\nOur goal is to root out the vampires that live in our fair city. So far, we've been unsuccessful finding one until now. It's come to the Order's attention that Temple District resident Roland Jenseric is a vampire, and has already claimed one victim. That's where you come in. We want you to slay this vampire and cleanse the city of his filth before he can feed or kill again.\nA few nights ago, I was roaming the city as I often do, looking for any signs of a vampire. As I headed past Roland's house I heard a cry. I rushed into the back garden to find Roland struggling with a woman he'd been courting. I tried to intervene, but he was too strong. He threw his lover to the ground and turned his attention on me. Luckily, I managed to run back into the street and escape his grasp. I hid for a while and then returned to the garden. Roland was gone and the woman was dead. She had two puncture marks on the nape of her neck. That's when I realized he was a vampire. The Order needs you to track him and destroy him.\nI would start by searching his home. He hasn't been there for days, so it should be safe. Return to us here if you have questions. We meet at night."

The ancient texts refer to this site only as the \"High Fane.\" Do you know it? Your first task is to locate the ruins of the High Fane. I believe it must now be known by a different name.\nThe High Fane dates from the Late Ayleid Period, following the fall of White Gold Tower, a very troubled time for that ancient people. A time I find most fascinating. The drawing on the bottom of the page I gave you depicts a carved panel from the central chamber of the High Fane. I believe this carving will shed new light on Ayleid history, if I am able to examine it closely. I would like you to retrieve it for me.\nYou will need this as well. It is the key to the inner chamber of the High Fane. I part with it reluctantly, so guard it well. It is what began my search for the High Fane, many years ago."

The unlucky kin are Perennia Draconis, Matthias Draconis, Andreas Draconis, Sibylla Draconis and Caelia Draconis. The locations of most of the family members are unknown, so you should begin your search with the family matron, Perennia, who resides at the farm called Applewatch.\nYou must discern the locations of all the Draconis family members and then systematically eliminate them. I suggest you first speak with the mother and find out if she has any valuable information on the whereabouts of her children, before ending her life.\nWhen every member of the Draconis family lies dead, journey to the city of Skingrad. In the castle courtyard you will find a well containing your reward for the Draconis contract, as well any further assignment I might have."

It's time to continue the good work.\nYour next target is a traveling Dark Elf merchant by the name of Alval Uvani, who is currently renting a house in the city of Leyawiin. Uvani is a well-respected tradesman back in his native Morrowind, but his business often takes him very far from home. Therein lies the problem. Alval Uvani's wife has become disillusioned with her husband's repeated, extended absences and wishes to dissolve their marriage, and has sought the Dark Brotherhood's assistance. Lucky for us Cyrodiil is a bit beyond the reach of Morrowind's Morag Tong.\nAlval Uvani is currently traveling around Cyrodiil, and is never in one place for more than a couple of days. In this dead drop you will also find a schedule detailing the Dark Elf's whereabouts; use it to locate him and plan your elimination. Be aware, however, that because he is forced to travel alone to the farthest reaches of the Empire, Uvani has learned to defend himself. He is a master of the Destruction school of Magicka, and is no stranger to killing.\nWhen Alval Uvani lies rotting, journey to the Market District of the Imperial City. There you will find a shop called Stonewall Shields. Your dead drop is located behind that building, in a hollowed-out tree stump. As usual, you will find your reward for the previous contract, as well as information on your next.\nAh yes, I must mention one last detail. Apparently Alval Uvani suffers from a rare Dark Elf condition, a serious allergy to honey. If you could somehow get Uvani to drink the honey-based mead, perhaps by replacing his food, he would suffer from complete paralyzation. This would certainly make the Dark Elf a bit easier to deal with."

Even when his necromantic studies resulted in our mutual expulsion from the Guild of Mages, I persisted in guiding him towards good with a gentle hand. Alas, in our exile, my old friend has mired himself in the foul practice, and in shocking discovery I learned he had become a miserly disciple of the Worm King, a cunning wraith. A Lich.\nFrail memory strengthened by dogmatic resolve, the Archmages turned me away when I came to them with my discovery. My pleas for a detachment of battlemages ignored, only my long-past expulsion remembered. And thus, the grave duty falls only to me. I must bear the burden of purging the Lich that was once a friend.\nI wander now into the foreboding maw of these catacombs known as the Lost Boy Caverns, far from the climes of common elves and men. With pure spirit and rites of cleansing, I hope to strike down the fearsome Lich and set free the soul of Erandur, but I leave this testament behind, lest I may never return from these depths; as a warning to those who may follow my path.\nFaithful, even in Exile,\nVangaril"

I assume you've noticed all of the Akaviri relics I'm displaying.\nWell, it's safe to say I'm a collector of sorts. I've invested a great deal of time and money acquiring these bits of ancient history. In fact, I'd be so bold as to proclaim my collection the most complete in all Cyrodiil; perhaps even beyond. Except for one thing.\nA particular relic has eluded me for many years. Possessing this piece of Akaviri antiquity would make my collection complete. I'm of course referring to The Draconian Madstone. The stone is a fine bit of Akaviri craftsmanship. Worn like an amulet, this talisman is said to protect the wearer from poisons of any type. The talisman appears as a snake coiled around and encircling itself. The eyes of the snake are supposed to be precious gems or some such. Through my sources, I've learned that the last reported location of the Draconian Madstone was the ruins at Pale Pass.\nIf you retrieve the Draconian Madstone for me, I'll be happy to compensate you by rewarding you with another Akaviri artifact. Are you in the game?\nLet me tell you how you're going to find the talisman. I've come into the possession of a diary written by an Akaviri messenger. I suspect that the text within can lead you to the ruins. Here's a translation of the passages we could still read. It was quite damaged. I've also included a rough map that was drawn in the diary as well. I'm also providing you with a unique key that was supposedly found with the diary. I'm assuming it will prove useful when you arrive at the site."

I now intend to put your talents to a more direct test.\nI have a difficult task that you can, perhaps, assist with. Let me explain what is at stake. The Council of Mages has been aware of the increased Necromancer activity in Cyrodiil for some time. It had been our position to sit back and watch what unfolded, but that time has clearly passed. We cannot tolerate these attacks on the guild. Most of our information on Necromancers has come from an informant inside the cult itself, a guild member who offered to infiltrate their ranks.\nThough the information he has provided is limited, it has given us a sense of their scope and power. The Council was initially reluctant to believe the information was reliable, but with recent events, they have little choice but to trust it. I fear that our informant is in danger, and that is why I have called you here.\nThe informant is a mage called Mucianus Allias. He is not a Council member, but has long served the guild here at the Arcane University. Aware in the growing interest in the guild after the band of Necromancy was put into place, he offered to help the Council track the cult's actions. With my blessing, he infiltrated the group, and has fed us information for quite some time, until recently. I have not heard from him, and I fear for his safety.\nThe lack of reports from Mucianus has disturbed the Council, and they are now concerned about the legitimacy of his information. A group of Battlemages were dispatched to Mucianus's last know location, with the intent on bringing him in for questioning. I argued against it, but eventually agreed to maintain order in the Council. I regret that decision, and that is why I wish to send you there. I fear the Battlemages may mistreat Mucianus, if they do not mistake him for one of the many Necromancers no doubt present in the ruins.\nI wish for you to find Mucianus, and ensure his safe return to the Arcane University. I do not want anything to go wrong. Please, hurry. The Battlemages will arrive there soon, if they have not already, and time is of the essence. If for any reason they are unsuccessful, Mucianus' life will be forfeit. You must make sure he is safe. Go now, and bring word to me as soon as he has been escorted to safety. Mucianus last reported being sent to the ruins of Nenyond Twyll, south of the Imperial City. That is where the Battlemages went. South of the White Rose River, nearly halfway to the border of Elsweyr. I'm afraid I know nothing more about the location, or what you may expect to find once you arrive."

Havilstein Hoar-Blood was more swine than man, and deserved to die quivering like an animal! You must not stop! You must kill again!\nYour next target is a Wood Elf named Ungolim, who resides in the city of Bravil. Bravil is also home to an ancient statue known as the Lucky Old Lady. It is seen as a symbol of good luck and prosperity, and the fools of Bravil often speak to the statue and wish for good tidings. Every night, poor lovestruck Ungolim visits the statue and pleads desperately for the heart of a young maiden. This maiden is married, and her husband has learned of Ungolim's affection for his bride. He fears the competition, it would seem, and has commissioned the Dark Brotherhood to help in the matter.\nYou must go to Bravil, locate Ungolim, and kill him. The Wood Elf owns a house in the city, but he spends his days securely locked inside. I recommend you lie in wait at the Lucky Old Lady statue, and then eliminate Ungolim when he arrives for his nightly visit. He's generally there between the hours of 6:00 PM and 1:00 AM.\nBy all accounts, Ungolim is a deadly archer and a fearless opponent. I also have reason to believe he is expecting trouble, so if Ungolim senses danger, he may attack you on sight. Be vigilant, and bring the Wood Elf down! You must not fail!\nWhen Ungolim's body lies broken at the foot of his dear statue, you must journey to the city of Anvil. Your dead drop is in a barrel located behind the statue in the pond. As is standard, your reward and next contract will be waiting."

I don't know what she does in there; frankly, I don't want to know. However, I do know that after she arrived, the woods at night became unsafe.\nI've seen undead of all types walking in the dark woods near the cave entrance. Now, this area's getting a bad reputation and my business has waned. Every day, it seems the number of undead increase.\nIf someone can get into the cave and kill Raelynn, maybe we can stem the tide. Her death pays a handsome bounty. I hope you'll take advantage of the opportunity. Raelynn will finally get what's coming to her."

I've been going out of my mind ever since my crew was murdered! This is my ship, you see. The Serpent's Wake. I hired the crew to sail to Summerset Isle to retrieve a family heirloom, my mother's crystal ball. They made the journey, and arrived back all right, but then... Someone murdered them! All of them! Now their spirits are haunting the ship!\nThe crystal ball is in a chest in the ship's hold, but I can't get to it. I made it as far as the captain's cabin, but the spirits nearly killed me! Get the crystal ball and return it to me here, and I'll make it worth your trouble. Here, you'll need this key. Thank you so much!\nThere will be a reward waiting for you! It's the captain's enchanted cutlass. I managed to grab it when I was in his cabin, before his spirit chased me out!"

They said it was worth thousands of drakes... enough to keep me comfortable for a while as I lay low. They also said the owner of the ring was out of town at some meeting of wizards or some such.\nThey were wrong on both counts. You'd think I'd be used to this by now, dealing with the unpredictable in our line of work. But after trying to fence the ring all over the realm, no one would touch it. Worse still, the wizard was pursuing me the entire time. I had to call in many favors to stay one step ahead of him.\nI decided to strike north and make for the neighboring land. As I was crossing the Jeralls, he finally caught up to me. Two fireballs later, I found myself tumbling down a steep snowy slope into a valley. Don't know where I am, but there are ruins of some old fort here. Luckily, that fetcher didn't follow me down; I assume he gave me up for dead.\nI think I'm going to stash the ring in this valley, cross the border north, and return later when I feel it's safe. I've used some old chests I found in the ruins to make sure nobody stumbles across the ring by mistake; you know, the old key to a key thing like we used to do. If I don't make it back here, and you're reading this message, then the ring is all yours, my friend. Use it well and remember me.\nG.S."

There you will find Shaleez, an Argonian hunter who was banished from her village near the Black Marsh/Morrowind border for the brutal murder of a Dark Elven family.

Shaleez is a skilled and deadly hunter, and will fight like the desperate fugitive she is.\nAfter Shaleez has been eliminated, your reward and another contract will be waiting at the dead drop located in a coffin, just outside the ruins of Fort Redman."

This necromancer, Celedaen, has not yet completed his metamorphosis, but is still immensely powerful, possibly too powerful to destroy if confronted directly. Search Leafrot Cave. Necromancers are wizards after all, and wizards are prolific by nature. Celedaen surely has written records, and these records may contain evidence of some kind of weakness. Perhaps there is some other way to destroy Celedaen besides a direct confrontation. But destroy him you must!\nWhen the necromancer lies dead, journey to the city of Chorrol for your next dead drop. At the foot of the Great Oak, hidden in the bushes, is an old sack. Inside you will find your reward for killing the necromancer, as well as information regarding your next contract.\nServe me well, Silencer, and there's no telling just how far you might advance."

            "description": "Dead Drop Orders #3\nby Lucien Lachance\n\nAre you ready to get your hands dirty, Silencer?\nYour next target is a Khajiit nobleman by the name of J'Ghasta, who can be found at his home in the city of Bruma. J'Ghasta was recently offered the hand of a prominent Cyrodiil noble's daughter, but turned down the offer when he learned of the girl's rather negligible dowry. The girl's family is outraged, of course, and has hired the Dark Brotherhood to make J'Ghasta pay for his insolence.\nGo to J'Ghasta's house in Bruma and end his miserable life. But be warned! The Khajiit is rich and bored, and spends most of his time honing his skills in unarmed combat. Any opponent who can kill with merely his hands is not to be trifled with, so tread carefully. Even worse, J'Ghasta is aware someone may be trying to kill him, and has bribed the guards not to interfere if a fight should spill out into the city streets.\nWhen the target has been eliminated, you will find your next dead drop in a rotten box under the Old Bridge, just south of the Imperial City. The box will contain your reward for killing J'Ghasta, as well as information regarding your next contract."

I heard the Dunmer identify himself as Raynil Dralas. He said he was a vampire hunter and that Bradon was his mark. The guards seemed to know about Raynil, and after a search of the house, the body of some beggar was found stashed in our basement. The guards sent for Carius, who is an investigator for crimes here in Bruma. In minutes, Raynil convinced Carius that Bradon was a vampire.\nWhy would he stash a body in his own house? That's ridiculous! And another thing. The guards are making a big deal out of no one seeing Bradon out in the daylight. Well of course that's the case! He works at night, and has to sleep during the day. Why does that make him a vampire? It's all that Raynil character. I don't trust him. The thing that bothers me the most is that I swear I've seen him before. Of course he says he's never been here. Look, there isn't much more to say.

Every Moth Priest is taught this ritual, but few ever get the chance to perform it... you should consider yourself fortunate if it works for you.\nOnce enough of the moths are following, they'll provide you with the second sight needed to decipher the Elder Scrolls.

If I tried, there'd be a knife in my back within a week.\nI can't take this anymore. I've begun skimming a little gold from the take, bringing it down here when I can. If I can scrape enough together, I'll make a run for it, head downriver to Dragon Bridge.\n\n28th of First Seed, 4E 201\nBrodir's getting suspicious -- I caught him poking around in the cove this afternoon. I don't think he found my stash, but it's not safe here. I took the boat out tonight and stowed it on the island to the south, by the old tree stump.\nHad a good haul this week.

He fed his entire family with the gold he made using that weapon. I'm not about to let it gather dust in some thief's trophy room.\nI tracked it to a group of bandits nearby. The place is called Halted Stream Camp. But I'm no fool. I'd need the Whiterun guards or maybe hire some mercenaries to get it. I don't know why I'm saying this, but if you find it out in your travels, I'd be grateful to you."

Happy, outgoing... Like anyone who's in love. See, Ranmir was involved with a pretty young woman named Isabelle Rolaine. The two of them were very happy together, I thought. One day, she just disappeared. Ranmir was convinced she'd run off with someone else, leaving him behind. He turned to drinking, and what's left of him is what you see here every day.\nI hoped that maybe if she could be found, if he had some sort of explanation, that maybe he could put himself back together. I'm in no position to go searching for her, but perhaps you could. Ranmir seemed convinced that Isabelle'd run off to Riften with someone named Vex. That's all I remember."

We have problems aplenty in Raven Rock.\nCommanding the Redoran Guard can be a difficult task. Even the most experienced warriors can fall prey to petty distractions. They usually didn't amount to much, but they make my job that much harder. Some of my own men have become quite accustomed to a spirit they called 'Emberbrand Wine.' Despise the stuff myself. It's powerful and tremendously addicting... I've seen men fail to finish even a single flask.\nIf I knew where they were stashing the bottles, I'd put an end to it myself. Could you track down the stash? That would be helpful. I just don't have time to do it myself right now.\nThey're too smart to have left it in the Bulwark. I'd search one of the abandoned houses on the outskirts of town."

And they're right here, in Skyrim.\nAt least two of the owners, Ghunzul and Drascua, are dangerous marauders.

Dug out a pile of the stuff taller than me just to find the barrow. Who knows how much to reach the door. Excavating isn't exactly my specialty. Even if it was, the ash storms fill it in faster than you can dig.\nCould you become my business partner? We can sort out the details of our little arrangement later, but for now, I'll manage the dig if you can manage the coin.\nWhen you have 1,000 gold for me, I'll head back to Raven Rock and round up some diggers.

It's said to be in four volumes and very hard to come by. My client is offering quite a reward for them, which I'd split with you.\nRecently, a woman was found... naked and shivering along the road to Dawnstar. The only information the guard could get from her were tales of strange experiments and Arondil scribbling in his journals.\nHe used to have a home in Dawnstar until they burned it down. The people say he was doing unspeakable experiments on reanimation... rituals only a necromancer would perform. After he made for Yngvild, he was never heard from again.\nIn his later years, Arondil moved into some ice caves known as Yngvild. He preferred the solitude in which to perform his, um... experiments."

You see, the caravans are notorious for transporting illegal substances.\nPresent Ri'saad with this satchel of Moon Sugar, and I bet my last coin he'll make a deal."

I've no doubt now that it hides the entrance to Kvenel's tomb.\nThe two keys must be hidden somewhere nearby - ceremonial replicas of Okin and Eduj, favored weapons when Kvenel went into battle. I don't dare explore further without hiring bodyguards to accompany me, however. To think - The Tongue Chieftain Kvenel could be entombed behind just a few feet of stone! The ancestor we scarcely believed was real.\nTwice damned for planning this foolish scouting trip. I should have hired those sellswords in the first place. Perhaps there's no need. This place is just a tomb, after all, and there are no obvious signs of habitation. It isn't as though the thousand-year dead will mind if I have a look around."

Raiding all along the coast, from Hammerfell to Vvardenfell.\nOur own security forces are limited, and all the mercenaries are tied up in this ridiculous war. We don't even know their base of operations, and attacking single ships won't really solve the problem.\nOnly the Shatter-Shields appear safe. They are a very powerful family here in Windhelm. They run a private shipping operation, and would love to have the docks to themselves. Wouldn't surprise me if they were in league with the pirates, somehow.\nNot yet, no. But perhaps an intrepid person such as yourself could help with that. They have a dark elf who oversees their operations. Suvaris Atheron. She's meticulous to a fault, and keeps a logbook with every transaction she makes.\nIf you get me the logbook, I'll have proof of Shatter-Shield's treachery."

It's huge, like a whole forest was just swallowed up by the earth, with a big old monument out in the center. Kyr took a sword from the monument as a trophy and dubbed it the \"Pale Blade\", proof his whole plan was finally paying off. For once, he might be right.\n\nRa'jirr's been having nightmares over the past few days. He keeps muttering about a \"Pale Lady\" - one of those swamp women who steal children away at night, I think. To think some fool story could turn the toughest bandit I know into a cowering kitten, frightened of his own shadow. I'm just glad none of the others see him like this.\n\nIt's getting worse. Ra'jirr can barely sleep at all now, and whenever he dozes off, he wakes up screaming - woke the whole place last night. He says the \"Pale Lady\" is coming for us - she's down in the forest, we have to return the sword or she'll kill us all. Not a chance - the boss clings to that thing like he was born with it. I've told everyone Ra'jirr just has a fever, but this can't go on. I've pulled a few things together. I'll slip out tonight and never look back."

The stone was pried off of Barenziah's ceremonial crown by a thief in order to cover his tracks.\nI think there were twenty-four in all; supposedly, all of them are in Skyrim. Most people keep them as a curiosity. Some of the Guild members have tried to locate them over the years, but they haven't been successful... well, until now.\nI only buy things I can turn around quickly for a profit. And no one wants those stones unless they have the whole set. Tell you what, if you find the rest of them, talk to me again. Otherwise, keep it and maybe it'll bring you luck."

I want you to know how widespread the injustice of Markarth is. Then, we might discuss about an early pardon."

I've made many forays into the ancient ruins that cover the island. I've come to know those ruins so well, I could draw you a map from memory. That's why I noticed the new passage the moment I laid eyes on it.\nit leads to an old tomb, I think. It must have been opened by an earthquake that accompanied one of the Red Mountain's eruptions. I'd love to have a closer look, but those old ruins can be dangerous and I'm no adventurer. I'll pay you to watch my back down there.\nI'll be heading back there soon. If you're interested, meet me at the ruins and we'll see what we can find. Now I'm off to pack for the expedition!"

This will compel the guardian to appear when you reach his lair.\nReturn when you've defeated the guardian wolf, crab and skeever."

Fortunately, his identity isn't known to the authorities in Whiterun, so there's still a chance to save him.\nThe job is two-fold. First, steal a letter that was sent from Solitude warning Whiterun's guard to be on the lookout for Arn. The second is to change Arn's name in the prison registry to his new identity.\nThe job is relatively difficult. If it was easy, I would have hired a local thug instead of a professional from the Thieves Guild. You see both of these items are kept inside Dragonsreach, and they don't allow visitors inside the Jarl's or the Steward's chambers.\nOne more thing.

Ramati keeps finding things missing from the cellar. Sudi said she heard a noise down there but Mani just thinks their mother is going mad from isolation. The very thought of it is ridiculous, she's always wanted to retire here!\nSudi keeps saying that she hears scratching coming from the cellar at night. I think she's just trying to get her mother's goat, but I'd better head into town to get a few traps just in case it's rats. Should only take a couple days. I just hope those two go easy on Ramati while I'm gone.\nOh gods. Oh gods why? I returned home to find my beautiful Ramati killed and this thing, this horrible bug-like creature ransacking our home. I managed to kill the damned thing, I think it might be a demon! I've never seen anything like it! Oh gods poor Ramati. It must have come out of the cellar. I'm going down there and locking the door behind me to make sure they don't escape. I don't know if I'll make it out, but I have to save my family!"

Conjurer's burn, as it's commonly referred to around the College. There's little doubt they were attempting a summoning ritual well beyond their capabilities.\nThe relic nearby put any doubt in this theory to rest. I admit that I've never seen one like it - a large, segmented sculpture of a gauntlet, the Daedric sigil 'O' emblazoned upon the palm. Attempts to move it were in vain. I must show it to the Archmage during his upcoming visit. Perhaps he will know more.\nWhile we couldn't move the relic, I was able to pry four \"rings\" from it. I'm sure there's a connection between them and the ritual the students were attempting.\nI'll store these in the Arcanaeum until we can consult with a conjuration master to learn more."

So little of what I have learned matters now - the petty politics of ancient times, the age-long campaign to wipe out all mention of the Gauldur name.\nIn the opening days of the First Era, the Archmage Gauldur was revered throughout the north. Wisdom, wealth, honor, and power were his, and even the legendary heros' heirs sought his counsel.\nSmothered by his shadow, Gauldur's three sons grew cruel and resentful. They lusted after their father's power and prestige, and eventually Jyrik, the eldest, discovered its source: a mysterious amulet, from which he never parted. Together, they conspired to murder their father in his sleep and divide his amulet between them. And so it was done.\nConsumed by their newfound power, the brothers laid waste to the surrounding villages. So great was the carnage that the High King himself intervened, sending a company of battlemages led by the Archmage Geirmund to subdue the brothers. And after a devastating battle, the three fled the field.\nMikrul, the youngest, was run to ground in Folgunthur, the ancient barrows at the foot of Solitude. Geirmund pursued Jyrik to the shattered crypts of Saarthal, half-buried even then. And at last, Sigdis was cornered in the southernmost reaches of land and later entombed in Geirmund's Hall."

Until he found a way to string the extra courses, bards only had six course lutes. The lute they stole is Finn's original eight course lute. I doubt they even realize its true value.\nThere is no way I can pay you what this Lute is worth. But I can teach you a few tricks I've learned over the years."

Been difficult trusting people lately, they think I'm crazy.\nMark my words, these mines hold a secret that could put Raven Rock back on the map. A secret the East Empire Company swept under the rug two centuries ago. It killed my great-grandfather, Gratian Caerellius, and left Raven Rock with a worthless and tainted mine.\nEast Empire Company called it \"a terrible accident\", claiming that he was lost in a rockfall, but I know better. My wife and I were cleaning out our home, and we came across some of my great-grandfather's things locked in an old chest. I found an unsent letter he'd written to the East Empire Company, and a key.\nThe letter describes a discovery that was made in the mine by some of the diggers. They wanted Gratian to take a closer look. The East Empire Company must have felt it was of great value, as they locked that section of the mine off from everyone else. I assume the key unlocks that section of the mine. I haven't been able to find the entrance.\nI'm telling you... there's something big down there, something that the East Empire Company wanted to hide from everyone."

You being the Listener. It's ridiculous. No offense. Cicero may have overheard me talking to one of the others about the Night Mother. It's possible I was... not entirely respectful. But to go this far. To attempt to murder the leader of a Sanctuary. Cicero must pay with his life. There is no other option.\nI want you to find that miserable little fool and end his life! But first... find my husband. Make sure he's all right. After the attack, Arnbjorn flew into a rage. When Cicero left... Arnbjorn went after him. They disappeared into the wild. Take my horse, Shadowmere. You'll find him outside, by the pool, when you go find Arnbjorn. Search Cicero's room here. Maybe there's something in there that sheds some light on where he might have gone.\nLet me know the minute you find something. I've got to see to Veezara, and calm everyone down."

Your next contract awaits, as I'm sure Astrid indicated.\nWith the Emperor's arrival in Skyrim now a certainty, his security service, the Penitus Oculatus, will need to begin its preparations immediately. Security is being handled by a Commander Maro. Astrid and I have devised a plan to break the man, and in doing so, cripple the Emperor's protection.\nYou are to slay the commander's son, Gaius Maro, and once he is dead, plant false evidence on his body implicating him in a plot to kill the Emperor. He is set to leave the Penitus Oculatus outpost at Dragon Bridge, and inspect the security of each city in Skyrim. Go there now. Observe Gaius Maro's departure, and follow him. Waylay him in one of the cities, and send his soul to Sithis. Once he's dead, plant the incriminating letter on his body, and let fate take care of the rest. Oh, and one final thing...\nTo earn your bonus, do not kill Gaius Maro in Dragon Bridge, or on the road. Kill him in one of the other major cities he'll be visiting. There, the body will be discovered quickly, as will the letter implicating Gaius Maro in the plot to assassinate the Emperor. Do that, and Astrid has authorized me to grant you a rather unique bonus. It is a special token, to be given to Olava the Feeble, in Whiterun. Olava is an old and dear friend, and a powerful seer. The token entitles you to a reading of your future. It's an opportunity one should not pass up."

This matter of beastblood has only troubled us for a few hundred. One of my predecessors was a good, but short-sighted man. He made a bargain with the witches of Glenmoril Coven. If the Companions would hunt in the name of their lord, Hircine, we would be granted great power.\nThe Companions of old became werewolves. They did not believe the change would be permanent. The witches offered payment, like anyone else. But we had been deceived. The disease, you see, affects not just our bodies. It seeps into the spirit. Upon death, werewolves are claimed by Hircine for his Hunting Grounds. For some, this is a paradise. They want nothing more than to chase prey with their master for eternity. And that is their choice. But I am still a true Nord. And I wish for Sovngarde as my spirit home.\nI've spent my twilight years trying to find a cure myself. And now I've found the answer. The witches' magic ensnared us, and only their magic can release us. They won't give it willingly, but we can extract their foul powers by force. I want you to seek them out. Go to their coven in the wilderness. Strike them down as a true warrior of the wild. And bring me their heads. The seat of their abilities. From there, we may begin to undo centuries of impurity."

A big dead tree isn't very inspiring if you're coming to worship the divine of wind and rains. Kynareth gives life, and we need a living tree to be her symbol.\nI've thought about restoring the Gildergreen... Trees like this never really die. They only slumber. I think if we had some of the sap from the parent tree, Eldergleam, we could wake up its child. But even if you could get to the Eldergleam, you couldn't tap it. Not with any normal metal. If you want to help, you'll need something to cut into it first.\nEldergleam is older than metal, from a time before men or elves. To even affect it, you have to tap into the old magic. You'll have to deal with the Hagravens. I've heard about a weapon they've made for sacrificing Kynareth's creations. It's called \"Nettlebane.\" The hags terrify me, or I would have gone after it myself. It's held in a Hagraven nest called Orphan Rock"

It will all unfold as she has predicted.\nYou must go to a fortress, endangered by water, yet untouched by it. Inside, you will find an elven mage who can turn the brightest star as black as night. It is cryptic, I know, but Azura's signs are never wrong. I believe the fortress may refer to Winterhold. Ask if they know this elven enchanter."

Their greatest achievement, however, has also been their greatest, shall we say... mystery.\nThis mystery is their disappearance, of course! Instant, unexplainable. The stories have fascinated me... Ever since I was young, I wanted to know what really happened. After years and years of work, I'm closing in on a way to investigate what happened through experimentation.\nOnly now... Well, it's simply a disaster. Without boring you with the, ahh, details, I am attempting to re-create the circumstances of the event. I used the soul gem you brought me for this. The soul gem by itself isn't enough, you see. It needs to be altered, purified. The Dwemer had machines for this sort of thing. I attempted to build my own, based on designs and using parts you helped to provide. My very own Dwemer machine. It worked, but not fully. And the uhh... The device was destroyed in the process.\nThe designs for my Convector were based on real Dwemer machines, so there may still be some in existence. I'd go looking myself, but uhh... Yes, there are calculations to double- and triple-check. Many calculations. Perhaps you could seek out these Convectors in Skyrim ruins? I can even teach you the spell to heat them.\nJust place the soul gem inside, and heat the Convector. At least three seconds. You'll almost certainly need to find multiple Convectors. I suspect it may be due to the nature of the soul gem versus the crystals this was intended for. Destroys the equipment in the process.\nBut, ahh... It's effective. Three times, and the crystal should be ready for the next step. Isn't this exciting?"

Not the most welcoming place, but depending on whose around, I'll be safe there. My father and I don't really get along. Ugh, saying it out loud makes it sound so... common. \"Little girl who doesn't get along with her father.\" Read that story a hundred times.\nHopefully we can find a boat to take us to my family's home."

I can help you find it, if you help me first.\nMy problem is this: I don't work for the Iron Throne because I wish to but rather because I have been forced. I have been enspelled with a geas. If I do not obey everything that Marek orders of me the spell will take effect and I shall waste away. I need a way to rid myself of the spell.

My task is very simple.\nSome years ago, an evil band of mercenaries were all petrified while trying to break into the home of Ramazith. For those of you with a limited vocabulary, petrified means \"turned to stone.\" Anyhow, one of those adventurers had in his possession an item of power: the Helm of Balduran. Ramazith didn't know this at the time and so, after turning them all to stone, he simply sold their bodies to an art collector living in the heart of Baldur's Gate.\nWhat I would like you to do is find these statues, turn them back to flesh, and take the item. I will give you these six scrolls of stone to flesh. Use them on the statues when you find them.\nThe estate can be found just west of the fairgrounds in the center of town. Good luck, and don't entertain any thoughts about betraying me. It could be very hazardous to your health.\nYou will be paid 5,000 gold for this service. This is a kingly sum, so I won't barter with you about the amount."

The Seven Suns leadership has been acting strangely of late. They've been selling off valuable assets and neglecting many of their more profitable trading ventures. Considering the importance that the trading coster holds over the economy of the city, the Grand Dukes are noticeably upset. I've gone to talk to the coster's head, Jhasso. He rudely rebuffed me, telling me to mind my own business. I've known Jhasso for many years, and this isn't his usual behavior. I can't start up an official investigation, as there is no real reason for doing so. That's why I need you.\nI want you to break into the Seven Suns compound and find out what's wrong. Use stealth in your investigations; I don't want this operation to cause too much fuss. The most important person to watch for is Jhasso.\nOnce you've found out as much as possible, report back to me at the Flaming Fist compound.\nI'll pay you 2,000 gold for this favor."

Dalton was always obsessed with the idea of being a hero.\nAlas, he has neither the brains nor the ability. Such is a mother's lot in life, however, to watch her children perform acts of idiocy despite her warnings or concerns.\nHe and his thick-skulled cohorts took it upon themselves to plumb the depths of Durlag's Tower. They bought a ward token from that shyster, Galken, and made ready to leave. Though I begged and cried, Dalton still insisted on going. The band never returned. I fear that they were destroyed by the mad dwarf's machinations. That is the tale, sad but true.\nPlease find my son if he still lives."

You'll be well paid for your services.\nThe problem is this: Every night people have been disappearing from the streets of the city. My men have been scouring the city trying to find the culprit, but so far to no avail. People have begun to get scared, and very few are willing to leave their homes at night. Something has to be done, and quickly. Would you be willing to take the job? I'd pay you 300 gold in advance with a 1,000 gold bonus if you discover what's been happening with the disappearing citizens.\nYour job is really simple. All I want you to do is patrol the east of the city and find an entrance to the sewers. Perhaps you'll get lucky and find out what's been happening. If you do find out what's been happening, come to see me at the Flaming Fist barracks. Our only clue so far has led us to the sewers, so if you want to explore them first, it would probably be a good idea. Also, we've found tracks of some many-legged creature, perhaps a centipede-like monster."

This year however, a group of woodland savages threatened us with bodily harm if we did not stop our hunting trip. Being civilized men, we realized that it's well within our rights to hunt where we damn well please. After a few more days of hunting, the crass woodmen lost all pretense of humanity and murdered Elban, one of my oldest friends.\nI'm sure that they plan to attack our cottage here, so we had best be prepared."

They almost take an active interest in squandering our company's resources on frivolous and stupid ideas. If they continue on this course, the company will be in shambles in but a few weeks. I know you have already helped me once, but I ask for your assistance again. I have no other recourse.\nCome into the Merchants' League Estate with me. I will explain that you are an old friend of mine and will quarter you in the guest chambers. From there, please investigate my partners, perhaps using magic or any of the other skills you possess.

The beauty of the dawn must be captured in every nook and cranny of Lathander's home.\nAthkatla is blessed with the presence of perhaps the greatest sculptor of our age. The artist is known as Sir Sarles, and he is making an all too brief visit. We would be foolish not to seize upon the opportunity to have him work for us.\nI would ask you to convince Sir Sarles that it would be best for him to work for us. Go to him now.\nSir Sarles is staying at the Jysstev estate. It is in the southeast section of the Government District.\nRemember, you speak for Lathander in this matter."

The youngest carried me here. He dressed all in red... strange and bright as you please.\nI woke up with this in my hand. I think I must have torn it off his shirt when he threw me in the grave.

There is much work to be done. Listen and learn the path of balance, the path of the Eternal Cycle.\nLong have the trolls of the mound lived beneath the protection of the grove. But a new leader has arisen. Nilthiri the shamaness leads the trolls to chaos. She urges them to expand their territory, and she brings more trolls to the mound without thought to the consequences. If this continues, the trolls will overrun the grove, and nature will suffer. A servant of nature must bring the life cycle of Nilthiri to a close for the good of all.\nYou will find Nilthiri along the path to the east of the troll mound."

Desharik had lost a war with another pirate king. Forced to this island, his ships invaded the town. They took our homes. Desharik killed our mayor and dumped his body into the sea. We were forced out into the streets.\nMy father could take no more injustice. He tried to get back into our house and was executed for breaking the law of the pirates. Once they've stolen something, the owner has no claim on it.\nDesharik said that we would have to pay for our father's \"crime.\" He gave us to Chremy, his lieutenant, as a reward for service. He put me to work as a courtesan for the drunken pirates. It's horrible, traveler! He says that he'll kill my brother Ason if I don't do it.\nThere is no escape for Ason and me. There is a smuggler who will take us, but we cannot afford to pay him. There is nowhere to run on this island.\nChremy can be found near the inn. The smuggler's name is Calahan. I hope that Calahan will take us with him when you kill Chremy. He will be near the docks. Please be careful!"

I would like to offer you the opportunity to help the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart.\nThe task of being a paladin is not easy. Many break under the demands of our path and leave to pursue avenues of life more appropriate to their talents. Sometimes they bend instead of break, twisting their paladinhood to serve their own purpose. These are hard to detect, but when found, they are quickly cast out.\nRecently, one of our highest-ranking officers was implicated in smuggling slaves. His name is Anarg, and though he was once a friend, he was expelled from the Order. We thought that the end of it, but Anarg took others when he left. He is a charismatic man, and some of the younger knights were swayed by his words. We could tolerate their loss, but they masquerade as paladins, abusing our good name. They extort, smuggle slaves, and spit on all that we honor. The Fallen Paladins, as they're known, would recognize any of our Order, and some also fear conflict with former friends, so we need outside help in this matter.\nThe Fallen Paladins always need warriors to aid their illegal activities. We want you to ally with them, especially Anarg. He's the key to them all. If you consider these men a threat, then do what you think is necessary. Gloves of Healing would be a suitable reward for the task, I think.\nAnarg has kept their activities localized in the Bridge District. I suggest you search there. May Torm be with you."

The Lurraxols seem to be possessed of the notion that their family founded this town... what an absurd thought!\nWhy they would even presume to suppose such a thing, I have no idea. It is sad, however, that the Alibakkars have never had the evidence to prove our claim to them... though it galls me that we would need it. All that has recently changed. An old tome belonging to my family states that there is proof \u2014 that proof can be found right here in Trademeet. In the graveyard is a tomb that has been long abandoned... but which also houses the founder of the town. My ancestor. With him lies a large circlet called the Mantle of Waukeen.\nPossessing that circlet would be all the proof I need, so I wish to acquire it. I would do so myself, but there happens to be a good reason the tomb is abandoned. It is... haunted, so they say. The exact nature of its danger I do not know... but you are a hero who surely could face its perils and return safely with the mantle, yes? In return, I shall pay you 1,000 gold. I shall give you the key, then, which will allow you into the tomb... the key itself having been in my family for some time as well. More proof, yes? Go, then, and return with the mantle."

The Alibakkars refuse to acknowledge the fact that we are the only true noble family in Trademeet, having founded it. Why they would think themselves higher than they are is beyond my ken. What is unfortunate, however, is that my family has never had actual, physical proof of the truth of our claim.\nThat has changed, however. A tome has recently been uncovered... an old tome belonging to my family... that states there is proof right here in Trademeet under our noses. In the graveyard, here in town, lies the crypt of the founder... my ancestor. With him lies the Mantle of Waukeen. A pretty name for an old gold circlet. That circlet, however, would prove my claim once and for all and shut those Alibakkars up. I would get it myself, but the tomb is haunted, you see. Here is the key to the tomb... the fact that we possess it is yet more proof of our legitimacy. Use it to enter and obtain the mantle, and then return to me when you are done.\nYou are a hero who might enter that tomb and retrieve the circlet for me, if you are willing.

Well, amongst some it is even worse than that... a burning, palpable hatred. One particular man here in Athkatla has murdered two of our number in cold blood. He is currently in hiding, and we need you to track the fellow down. We have been unable to do so, much to our frustration. Cowled Wizards cannot be assaulted without repercussions or it will lead to... serious problems.\nHe is Valygar Corthala, last son of a wealthy family and a true brute. Ask around and you may discover if he is hiding within the city or someplace else. He has a home here in the Docks District, or he may have fled to the Umar Hills. His friends and servants will not speak to us, but they may to you.\nWe do not ask that you commit any murder. We wish Valygar be delivered to us, that is all. He will likely resist, so if you must kill him, so be it. But if you do kill him, I simply must have his body. Valygar must be delivered to us whether he is dead or alive. You understand, yes?"

The enemy came through a small sewer outlet that was protected by both a locked iron grate and several powerful magical wards. There is no way to open that entrance from the outside. But Mateo is a faithful soldier, not the type of man to betray Saradush.\nAn alarm was raised, and my soldiers arrived only a few moments after the gate was opened. We found three soldiers in the area: Mateo, Ardic Santele, and the merchant Kiser Jhaeri. We didn't get a chance to complete our investigations. Ardic, the son of the Countess Santele, disappeared. He was our primary witness. Our attention was focused on the vile Kiser Jhaeri, but we had no proof. Then the countess told us that Ardic, her son, had implicated Mateo before he disappeared.\nIf you wish to investigate further, I will not stand in your way. Speak to Mateo in his cell.

I beg of you to help a humble wizard! At first, I suspected Hectan... he is well known about town for his sticky fingers. But after questioning many witnesses, it is clear that Hectan was at the local pub from dusk until dawn the night of the theft. I still suspect that no-good thief Hectan was involved \u2014 I can clearly see the guilt in his face! But there is no proof. Without my spellbook, I am virtually powerless to pursue this myself, and as a newcomer to this town, I have no one to turn to for help.\nI regret that there is little else I can tell you. Hectan can usually be found in the Tankard Tree if you wish to question him.\nI urge you godspeed."

In Calimshan, there are many strange wonders of magic, and Vongoethe is not out of place. It is he who has chased us here, hunting us mercilessly. Vongoethe desired my poor Malla, my daughter. She is the young woman here on the bed. A... a good girl, a virgin and pure of heart. He desired her soul, he said, so I fled Calimshan with her. But he caught up to us nevertheless. And somehow he has taken her soul despite my efforts! She... she lies near death, and there is nothing the local priestess can do to help her. I know Vongoethe is in the cavern that serves as a graveyard in this place. I told the monks about him... but they sealed off the cavern rather than somehow getting my daughter's soul back as I had hoped.\nMalla is the world to me! And I do not know how much longer Vongoethe will remain trapped in that cavern... he could already be loose! He will kill me and keep Malla's soul, I am sure of it!\nGetting inside the cavern is not a problem. I... paid the guard there what little money I have left. I had thought to... try and get Malla's soul myself. But the guard will let in whomever I ask him to.\nI have no coin left to offer you. I have bankrupted myself in trying to flee the lich's reach. But... Vongoethe himself is a powerful wizard. Surely he has items that would interest you, that you could take from him!"

The time has come to strike back to protect our people and the city she has invaded.\nGo to the Graveyard District and find their hideout. There is a network of tombs beneath the graves where another spy tracked one of Bodhi's servants. There you shall find a set of blue doors just north of a spider den. The doors are too heavy for any mortal to open, but the vampires likely pass with ease. I shall send a mage to meet you there and arrange for the doors to be opened. Here, you shall need these stakes if you are to truly finish these creatures.\nBe on your guard. This Bodhi is the most intelligent and brutal foe I have ever had. If we are lax in our vigilance, we will be at the disadvantage. When you have destroyed their evil, return to me and I will fulfill our bargain."

A kind villager from this very village found me and helped me regain my strength. I left my pirate days behind, and settled down in Seaside Settlement.\nHowever, I'd still like to obtain my notebook from those days: I accidentally dropped it into the last treasure chest we buried into the ground. My adventuring days are over: you, however, are known to do odd tasks of more or less adventurous nature to others. I'll give you my treasure map: it will lead you to the buried treasure.\nYou may keep the buried treasure to yourself, I just ask you to give me my notebook."

Are you stocking up on supplies on your way to explore desert ruins?\nIf you are, I would like your help. I promise to pay you with something useful. The thing is, there's this ancient pyramid, Tut's Temple, a short way away from this village. It is said to be full of treasure! And some highly lethal traps that are too much to overcome for a meager researcher like me. There are also rumors that say that the ancients had useful devices lost to time. I'd love to get my hands on one, for science.\nPlease, go to Tut's Temple and find an ancient device! It may tell us about many lost crafts!"
