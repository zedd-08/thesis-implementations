This tree is the source of our problems. It is an abomination of nature, and it must be destroyed. As long as the Blackwood Company has access to the sap, we are all in danger. I fear they no longer know what they do.\nYou must find a way to destroy the Hist, though I can imagine Ri'Zakar will have it well guarded. He's a warrior, a battle-hardened mercenary who's spent time all over Tamriel. He'll keep his prize tree locked away. You'll need to find his key.\nExpect an unfriendly welcome at their hall. Finish it."

I now intend to put your talents to a more direct test.\nI have a difficult task that you can, perhaps, assist with. Let me explain what is at stake. The Council of Mages has been aware of the increased Necromancer activity in Cyrodiil for some time. It had been our position to sit back and watch what unfolded, but that time has clearly passed. We cannot tolerate these attacks on the guild. Most of our information on Necromancers has come from an informant inside the cult itself, a guild member who offered to infiltrate their ranks.\nThough the information he has provided is limited, it has given us a sense of their scope and power. The Council was initially reluctant to believe the information was reliable, but with recent events, they have little choice but to trust it. I fear that our informant is in danger, and that is why I have called you here.\nThe informant is a mage called Mucianus Allias. He is not a Council member, but has long served the guild here at the Arcane University. Aware in the growing interest in the guild after the band of Necromancy was put into place, he offered to help the Council track the cult's actions. With my blessing, he infiltrated the group, and has fed us information for quite some time, until recently. I have not heard from him, and I fear for his safety.\nThe lack of reports from Mucianus has disturbed the Council, and they are now concerned about the legitimacy of his information. A group of Battlemages were dispatched to Mucianus's last know location, with the intent on bringing him in for questioning. I argued against it, but eventually agreed to maintain order in the Council. I regret that decision, and that is why I wish to send you there. I fear the Battlemages may mistreat Mucianus, if they do not mistake him for one of the many Necromancers no doubt present in the ruins.\nI wish for you to find Mucianus, and ensure his safe return to the Arcane University. I do not want anything to go wrong. Please, hurry. The Battlemages will arrive there soon, if they have not already, and time is of the essence. If for any reason they are unsuccessful, Mucianus' life will be forfeit. You must make sure he is safe. Go now, and bring word to me as soon as he has been escorted to safety. Mucianus last reported being sent to the ruins of Nenyond Twyll, south of the Imperial City. That is where the Battlemages went. South of the White Rose River, nearly halfway to the border of Elsweyr. I'm afraid I know nothing more about the location, or what you may expect to find once you arrive."

While my mother didn't survive, Reynald did, and for that I'm grateful.\nBut we both want more - we want our home back. We're not fighters; you appear to have more skill than either of us.

We believe it's somewhere south of Chorrol, but southwest of Fort Carmala. It may be difficult to find.

Summoned in spirit form is not raised from the dead. She'll need help before she can return to the living.\nFor the moment, the Wolf Queen has retreated to a place filled with dead eager to serve her. She has gone to her old Catacombs. A few days ago, one of her servants busted through a wall into the Temple of Divines. We'll need you to go into the Catacombs themselves.\nYou were there when Potema was summoned. Being at the summoning created a connection to Potema, you are the one to stop her from returning to the living. I can provide you with some help with her minions.\nAs to Potema herself, find what's left of her body, likely a skeleton. Remove it from the Catacombs and bring it back to be sanctified by Arkay."

I attempted to return to the service of the Nine, but the war had changed me. I no longer had sympathy for the weak, or pity for the suffering. In the brief time I was there, I did more to hurt the Chapel of Stendarr than help it. It was there that I was cursed.\nA beggar who came to the Chapel each day for help tried my patience one too many times. I lost my temper, and struck him. My blow landed harder than I had intended, and he fell to the floor, dead. Killed in the very Chapel of the God of Mercy. I left the Chapel at once, of course, but the damage was done. I was weak, constantly weary, and lacked the energy to do almost anything.\nAs proof of the deed, when I struck the poor man the Gauntlets slipped right off my hands and fell to the floor. Heavy as stone, they would not move. None could lift them. I suspect they lie there still, in Chorrol's Chapel. You must prove to Stendarr you are worthy to lift the Gauntlets once more. Seek out the priests of Stendarr in Chorrol. Perhaps they can help you."

I've ordered an extra ration of mead, but unless this fighting stops, we'll tear ourselves apart.\n\n11th of First Seed, 4E 201\nRumor is that Herd's gathering followers for a mutiny. Brodir's not stupid; he's probably doing the same, just for insurance. I'd kill them both myself, but the camp's split right down the middle. If I tried, there'd be a knife in my back within a week.\nI can't take this anymore. I've begun skimming a little gold from the take, bringing it down here when I can. If I can scrape enough together, I'll make a run for it, head downriver to Dragon Bridge.\n\n28th of First Seed, 4E 201\nBrodir's getting suspicious -- I caught him poking around in the cove this afternoon. I don't think he found my stash, but it's not safe here. I took the boat out tonight and stowed it on the island to the south, by the old tree stump.\nHad a good haul this week. Another caravan or two and I can finally get out of here, and not a moment too soon."

That's why I noticed the new passage the moment I laid eyes on it.\nit leads to an old tomb, I think. It must have been opened by an earthquake that accompanied one of the Red Mountain's eruptions. I'd love to have a closer look, but those old ruins can be dangerous and I'm no adventurer. I'll pay you to watch my back down there.\nI'll be heading back there soon.

It seems Lachance wanted revenge against the Dark Brotherhood for some reason, and used you to do his dirty work. But now, we can begin anew!\nI bestow upon you the title of Speaker. You will take Lucien Lachance's place on the Black Hand! Welcome! As you know, the Black Hand is now in a state of disarray. Lachance ordered you to kill us off! We five, including you, are now all that remain. Even worse, you killed the Listener! The Black Hand without a Listener is like a hand with no thumb. Even the Listener's successor is dead!\nSo, we have no choice but to invoke an ancient ritual. We must wake the Night Mother from her slumber, and seek her guidance! Between the hours of midnight and 3:00 AM, ask me about the Night Mother, and we will away to our Lady's home in Bravil. Only then will the ritual begin.\nMay the Night Mother hold you in her cold embrace."

My client is offering quite a reward for them, which I'd split with you.\nRecently, a woman was found... naked and shivering along the road to Dawnstar. The only information the guard could get from her were tales of strange experiments and Arondil scribbling in his journals.\nHe used to have a home in Dawnstar until they burned it down. The people say he was doing unspeakable experiments on reanimation... rituals only a necromancer would perform. After he made for Yngvild, he was never heard from again.\nIn his later years, Arondil moved into some ice caves known as Yngvild. He preferred the solitude in which to perform his, um... experiments."

We tried to eliminate Phillida, of course, but failed on three separate occasions. He's a powerful man, and was surrounded by powerful associates. Now the Legion's pig's years of service have come to an end. He has retired. Phillida must not be allowed such a victory! His destiny is... darker. Phillida now resides in Leyawiin, in the City Watch barracks, an honored guest of the soldiers there. He is, in fact, more vulnerable than ever.\nThe Black Hand has sanctioned the Rose of Sithis. It is a magic arrow specifically enchanted to kill its target. In this case, Phillida. As long as the arrow hits Phillida, he will die. But it cannot pierce armor! Shoot while Phillida is armored, and the Rose will be wasted. Travel to Leyawiin. Track Phillida. Learn his schedule. Observe when he removes that blasted Legion armor! And then, let fly the Rose of Sithis! Kill Phillida in any way, Rose or not, and the contract is complete. But to receive a bonus, you must go beyond murder. You must send a message! Once Phillida is dead, take the very finger from his corpse, the one that bears an Imperial Legion signet ring! Deposit this finger in the desk of Phillida's successor, in his office in the Prison Barracks, in the Imperial City! Do this, and the bonus is yours."

I confess I have a weakness for crystals of a magical nature, and I must add these to my collection. This is a personal errand, you must understand. Just between you and I. The Mages Guild has nothing to do with it.\nThe Tears are not just a namesake. They're literally the frozen tears of a knight named Garridan Stalrous who lived many years ago. I'm not certain what happened to the knight, or why the tears were frozen, but I do know someone you could ask. Seek out Julienne Fanis at the Arcane University in the Imperial City. She oversees the Alchemy Headquarters there. If anyone can help you get more information on about these crystals, she can."

All I want you to do is find him and take his spellbook. I have enough magical skill to reverse the curse if I had the formula for his spell."

        "description": "Greetings. I'm Nerussa. I'm quite fond of collecting all manners of wines from all over Tamriel. But one vintage continues to elude me: Shadowbanish Wine. How I'd love to add it to my collection.\nApparently the wine is so rare because it was only made in one tiny batch. It's the product of an alchemist who was also a vintner. Besides tasting incredible, the magic within the wine allows the imbiber to be gifted with Night Eye! The vintner made it special for the Legion soldiers posted at the forts when they were active long ago. It was perfect for keeping lookouts warm on cold nights and helping them see better in the dark.\nIf you can retrieve six bottles of Shadowbanish Wine, I'll gladly pay you well: 1,000 gold. All I know about them is that they're found in the many fort ruins scattered all over Cyrodiil."

It's time to continue the good work.\nYour next target is a traveling Dark Elf merchant by the name of Alval Uvani, who is currently renting a house in the city of Leyawiin. Uvani is a well-respected tradesman back in his native Morrowind, but his business often takes him very far from home. Therein lies the problem. Alval Uvani's wife has become disillusioned with her husband's repeated, extended absences and wishes to dissolve their marriage, and has sought the Dark Brotherhood's assistance. Lucky for us Cyrodiil is a bit beyond the reach of Morrowind's Morag Tong.\nAlval Uvani is currently traveling around Cyrodiil, and is never in one place for more than a couple of days. In this dead drop you will also find a schedule detailing the Dark Elf's whereabouts; use it to locate him and plan your elimination. Be aware, however, that because he is forced to travel alone to the farthest reaches of the Empire, Uvani has learned to defend himself. He is a master of the Destruction school of Magicka, and is no stranger to killing.\nWhen Alval Uvani lies rotting, journey to the Market District of the Imperial City. There you will find a shop called Stonewall Shields. Your dead drop is located behind that building, in a hollowed-out tree stump. As usual, you will find your reward for the previous contract, as well as information on your next.\nAh yes, I must mention one last detail. Apparently Alval Uvani suffers from a rare Dark Elf condition, a serious allergy to honey. If you could somehow get Uvani to drink the honey-based mead, perhaps by replacing his food, he would suffer from complete paralyzation. This would certainly make the Dark Elf a bit easier to deal with."

Not at all. I need as much help as I can get.\nIn fact, if you could retrieve a few things for me, I could start on my next set of experiments. What I need is my Dwemer Spoon, my Orichalcum Ingot and my Grand Soul Gem. In fact, I could use them immediately.\nWell... why are you still standing here? Oh, right. You need to know where they are! That would help. Let's see. Last time I used the Dwemer Spoon was at my dear friend Boti's house in Ivarstead... Fellstar Farm I believe it's called. The Orichalcum Ingot should still be in Winterhold at the Frozen Hearth Inn. I don't know why I didn't just take it with me. And last is the gem. I left that one in Windhelm at the White Phial alchemy shop. It was a good trade too. Ah well.\nBring those items back to me and I'll be happy to experiment on you. No, no... that isn't right. I'd be happy to reward you."

This year however, a group of woodland savages threatened us with bodily harm if we did not stop our hunting trip. Being civilized men, we realized that it's well within our rights to hunt where we damn well please. After a few more days of hunting, the crass woodmen lost all pretense of humanity and murdered Elban, one of my oldest friends.\nI'm sure that they plan to attack our cottage here, so we had best be prepared."

That is, until last year.\nJorundr started to take risks and began robbing more dangerous targets. Not just lone merchants, mind you. I'm talking about the bigger scores. Like estates and tax shipments. I begged him to stop, as I knew that his capers would one day lead to violence. He just threatened to... hurt me if I got in his way. I think the gold changed him. I really do. He wasn't the man I met seven years ago. The few times I tried to say something, he'd strike me or push me away. I began to become frightened of him.\nOur last score was a tax shipment being delivered to the Imperial City. We robbed it, and in the midst of the chaos, Jorundr killed a guard. I was mortified. We snatched up the gold and holed up in the mountains. He said if I breathed a word of the murder to anyone, he'd kill me. I was terrified of him at this point. Two days later, the Bruma City Guard traced us to our makeshift campsite. I was off gathering food, but Jorundr was captured. Served him right. When I went back to the site later, the gold was gone! He'd moved it! What I need you to do is go to the Bruma Castle Dungeons and speak to him for me. Convince him to tell you where the gold is and then we split it."

J'Ghasta was recently offered the hand of a prominent Cyrodiil noble's daughter, but turned down the offer when he learned of the girl's rather negligible dowry. The girl's family is outraged, of course, and has hired the Dark Brotherhood to make J'Ghasta pay for his insolence.\nGo to J'Ghasta's house in Bruma and end his miserable life. But be warned! The Khajiit is rich and bored, and spends most of his time honing his skills in unarmed combat. Any opponent who can kill with merely his hands is not to be trifled with, so tread carefully. Even worse, J'Ghasta is aware someone may be trying to kill him, and has bribed the guards not to interfere if a fight should spill out into the city streets.\nWhen the target has been eliminated, you will find your next dead drop in a rotten box under the Old Bridge, just south of the Imperial City. The box will contain your reward for killing J'Ghasta, as well as information regarding your next contract."

Well, amongst some it is even worse than that... a burning, palpable hatred. One particular man here in Athkatla has murdered two of our number in cold blood. He is currently in hiding, and we need you to track the fellow down. We have been unable to do so, much to our frustration. Cowled Wizards cannot be assaulted without repercussions or it will lead to... serious problems.\nHe is Valygar Corthala, last son of a wealthy family and a true brute. Ask around and you may discover if he is hiding within the city or someplace else. He has a home here in the Docks District, or he may have fled to the Umar Hills. His friends and servants will not speak to us, but they may to you.\nWe do not ask that you commit any murder. We wish Valygar be delivered to us, that is all. He will likely resist, so if you must kill him, so be it. But if you do kill him, I simply must have his body. Valygar must be delivered to us whether he is dead or alive. You understand, yes?"

This is not quite in your usual line of work, but I hope you can help me just the same.\nA rival collector has an item, the Crown of Nenalata, which I very much want to add to my collection. But she stubbornly refuses to consider any of my offers. She and I have had our differences over the years, I admit. Now she is taking this opportunity to get her revenge. I believe that you may be able to persuade her to part with the item, where I cannot due to her prejudice against me. Her name is Herminia Cinna. She lives here in the Imperial City, in the Elven Gardens district.\nI hope you will succeed where I have so far failed. Afterwards, in order to bring my research on the last king of the Ayleids to its final stage, I need to go to the Throne Room of Nenalata. While I am not without means of defending myself, I believe you would be an invaluable companion on such an expedition. Your reward will be whatever plunder you wish to carry off from Nenalata. Since the Throne Room has been sealed since the time of the Ayleids, it should provide rich pickings."

So maybe you could ask Isran if he knows anything?\nJust keep in mind that Isran... well, he might not like the idea. The two of them just never got along."

There's one in Skyrim, in the Pine Forest.\nPerforming the Ritual of the Ancestor Moth within the glade should provide the answers you seek. It involves carefully removing the bark from a Canticle Tree which will in turn attract Ancestor Moths to you.\nIn keeping with tradition, you must use a specific tool in the Ancestor Glade, an implement known as a Draw Knife. Every Moth Priest is taught this ritual, but few ever get the chance to perform it... you should consider yourself fortunate if it works for you.\nOnce enough of the moths are following, they'll provide you with the second sight needed to decipher the Elder Scrolls. From what I saw in the vision, the Elder Scroll which foreshadows the defiance of the gods with the blood of mortals is the key to the prophecy."

Traditionally the city has not collected taxes from them, even though by law they could. The money the city would collect would barely cover the cost of collecting. The Gray Fox has always guaranteed protection to the poor of the waterfront. He doesn't want to let this injustice stand. It's a matter of principle.\nFind out where Hieronymus Lex is keeping the taxes and bring them to me. I'll also need the tax records of what each citizen paid so we can return it."

I told him to stop, but he didn't listen. He was certain he could win us a fortune and move us somewhere nicer, like the Imperial City. It didn't take long for Aleron to begin losing. He resorted to borrowing money from a usurer to cover his losses and place new bets. As you can imagine, it didn't pay off. He ended up owing around 500 gold. We could never have that kind of money to pay back the usurer.\nYesterday, the usurer, Kurdan gro-Dragol, sent for my husband to meet him at the Lonely Suitor Lodge. He hasn't returned since. I fear for his life. Kurdan isn't known for his patience. Please, I'm not wealthy, but I'd give anything to see Aleron again.

But for the first time, it seems that someone may succeed where we have failed. I see in you the chance to redeem our souls and restore the order. And now, I must ask you to press forward where I could not. I must ask you to face the challenge of Zenithar.\nI was arrogant and foolhardy. I sought personal glory. I placed my own will and my own lust for fame over the will of the Nine. In facing the challenge of Zenithar, I failed. I tried dozens -- no, hundreds of times to reach the Mace. I fell each time. And each time I awoke in the chapel, I leaped again. I tried to enlist the help of the other knights, but none would come to my aid. The inscription says to \"walk in the faith\" but even now, I do not know what this means.\nBelow the Chapel of Zenithar in Leyawiin there is a shrine to the great craftsman, Saint Kaladas. Those seeking the Mace must pray before the shrine. When you bow, you will receive a vision -- or perhaps not. It is unclear. The priests saw that my body never moved, but it felt so real. You will see the Mace of Zenithar, separated from you by a great chasm. The chasm represents your doubt. Your faith must be your guide across it.\nThis is what I know. As I said, my faith was weak. I did not understand the test and I fell from the platform each time I tried to cross. I have told you all that I know. All that is left is for you to prove yourself more worthy than I. If you seek the Mace, travel to Leyawiin's chapel, kneel at the shrine in the undercroft, and let your faith in the Nine be the salvation of us all."
