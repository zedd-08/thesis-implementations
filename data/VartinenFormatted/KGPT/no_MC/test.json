Now I'm paying for it with more than just some gold. A few weeks ago, a spellsword was passing through Leyawiin and heard that I like to buy curiosities. He wanted to sell the staff you see me carrying. I eagerly bought it, knowing the value of Daedric relics. In fact, I was a bit suspicious when he sold it so cheap. His loss, my gain I figured. After examining it for a bit I noticed a small word carved on it in runes. Using a book from my library, I translated it. The word was nonsense. However, when I spoke it and held the staff, four scamps suddenly appeared! I thought I was done for! Strangely, they all just stood there. It didn't take long before I realized they were following me! I couldn't be seen in town with scamps following, so I decided to discard the staff. I can't explain it, but somehow I can't compel myself to actually let it go. This staff is obviously cursed! Now I'm stuck with it.\nOh please, I beg you! Take this staff to Darkfathom Cave and get rid of it and the scamps forever! I can't fight, and who knows what's guarding the shrine? Plus, do you know how dirty caves are? It'll ruin anything I wear!\nDo this for me, and I'll reward you with another one of my curios I picked up a few years ago... a valuable ring. Ring of Eidolon's Edge."

Let me explain.\nThe women in the gang use their wiles to lure men out to some remote location and rob them blind. It's been going on for some time now. The city guard hasn't done very much about it, because frankly, the men who are robbed are so embarrassed, they don't want to report it. Take for example that good-for-nothing husband of mine, Gogan. He cared more about their charms than my own.\nWhen Gogan was, uh... with the women, they took something quite valuable from him. No... it's not what you're thinking. He was carrying a precious family heirloom with him when he was lured out to their lair. It was a small ring given to him on our wedding day. The ring belonged to my mother, and has been in the family for generations. I'm willing to give you all the money I have to get it back. 100 gold. Can you help us?\nAll I can tell you is that the best place to start is at The Flowing Bowl. It's a tavern located outside the city walls near the waterfront. The Flowing Bowl attracts the worst Anvil has to offer. Always be on your guard."

I heard the Dunmer identify himself as Raynil Dralas. He said he was a vampire hunter and that Bradon was his mark. The guards seemed to know about Raynil, and after a search of the house, the body of some beggar was found stashed in our basement. The guards sent for Carius, who is an investigator for crimes here in Bruma. In minutes, Raynil convinced Carius that Bradon was a vampire.\nWhy would he stash a body in his own house? That's ridiculous! And another thing. The guards are making a big deal out of no one seeing Bradon out in the daylight. Well of course that's the case! He works at night, and has to sleep during the day. Why does that make him a vampire? It's all that Raynil character. I don't trust him.

Nor do you, I'm sure. So we require a Dremora to retrieve one for us. You will summon one, and order it to bring a sigil stone to you. I will then inscribe the spells for you.\nBut there are risks. There are always risks. You must summon and command an unbound Dremora. Summoning an Unbound Dremora is not like other Conjuration spells. It will not simply do your bidding. You must first prove you are in control.\nI will teach you the spell to summon the Dremora, but know that it will only work in a place properly prepared for the event. Here is the spell you need. Go to the top of the Hall of Attainment; I have prepared a place for you there."

That would help. Let's see. Last time I used the Dwemer Spoon was at my dear friend Boti's house in Ivarstead... Fellstar Farm I believe it's called. The Orichalcum Ingot should still be in Winterhold at the Frozen Hearth Inn. I don't know why I didn't just take it with me. And last is the gem. I left that one in Windhelm at the White Phial alchemy shop. It was a good trade too. Ah well.\nBring those items back to me and I'll be happy to experiment on you. No, no... that isn't right. I'd be happy to reward you."

You should look into retrieving it. It is a magical shield that when blocked with, surrounds its wielder with a holy aura that harms the undead.

Ramazith didn't know this at the time and so, after turning them all to stone, he simply sold their bodies to an art collector living in the heart of Baldur's Gate.\nWhat I would like you to do is find these statues, turn them back to flesh, and take the item. I will give you these six scrolls of stone to flesh. Use them on the statues when you find them.\nThe estate can be found just west of the fairgrounds in the center of town. Good luck, and don't entertain any thoughts about betraying me. It could be very hazardous to your health.\nYou will be paid 5,000 gold for this service. This is a kingly sum, so I won't barter with you about the amount."

They are hunting a rakshasa named Ihtafeer and insist that she is present in the town.\nThe genies will allow no trade to occur until Ihtafeer is found and her head given to them. Why... why they have chosen this particular tactic, I am unsure.\nWithout proper trade, however, the merchants are penniless. Soon, the food resources will dry up as well, so something must be done... and done soon.\nPerhaps you might be able to look into this genie issue for us? Guildmistress Busya in the next room can tell you more about what needs to be done."

I would like to offer you the opportunity to help the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart.\nThe task of being a paladin is not easy. Many break under the demands of our path and leave to pursue avenues of life more appropriate to their talents. Sometimes they bend instead of break, twisting their paladinhood to serve their own purpose. These are hard to detect, but when found, they are quickly cast out.\nRecently, one of our highest-ranking officers was implicated in smuggling slaves. His name is Anarg, and though he was once a friend, he was expelled from the Order. We thought that the end of it, but Anarg took others when he left. He is a charismatic man, and some of the younger knights were swayed by his words. We could tolerate their loss, but they masquerade as paladins, abusing our good name. They extort, smuggle slaves, and spit on all that we honor. The Fallen Paladins, as they're known, would recognize any of our Order, and some also fear conflict with former friends, so we need outside help in this matter.\nThe Fallen Paladins always need warriors to aid their illegal activities. We want you to ally with them, especially Anarg. He's the key to them all. If you consider these men a threat, then do what you think is necessary. Gloves of Healing would be a suitable reward for the task, I think.\nAnarg has kept their activities localized in the Bridge District. I suggest you search there. May Torm be with you."

Besides tasting incredible, the magic within the wine allows the imbiber to be gifted with Night Eye! The vintner made it special for the Legion soldiers posted at the forts when they were active long ago. It was perfect for keeping lookouts warm on cold nights and helping them see better in the dark.\nIf you can retrieve six bottles of Shadowbanish Wine, I'll gladly pay you well: 1,000 gold. All I know about them is that they're found in the many fort ruins scattered all over Cyrodiil."

I'm not sure the numbers you'll be dealing with, so I'm sending you with another new recruit. Maglir. I believe you two have already met.\nGet moving. You need to get rid of those thieves."

Show the papers to him, and he'll let you in the guild house proper.\nI think you will find the reward adequate. 10,000 gold is no small fortune, though I think you deserve a little more. From my personal armory, a sword."

I want you to bring me as many of Garridan's Tears as you can find. If you do, I will pay you a fair bounty in gold for each one. I confess I have a weakness for crystals of a magical nature, and I must add these to my collection. This is a personal errand, you must understand. Just between you and I. The Mages Guild has nothing to do with it.\nThe Tears are not just a namesake. They're literally the frozen tears of a knight named Garridan Stalrous who lived many years ago. I'm not certain what happened to the knight, or why the tears were frozen, but I do know someone you could ask. Seek out Julienne Fanis at the Arcane University in the Imperial City. She oversees the Alchemy Headquarters there. If anyone can help you get more information on about these crystals, she can."

And we know they're good at what they do.\nI've heard stories, but nothing I can prove is true. Maybe they've got a mage working with them. Maybe they're just well trained. All I know for sure is that they'll accept any contract, and they'll do anything to complete it. And they don't care who gets in the way.\nWe were contracted by a wizard, Argoth, to recover an artifact from Azani Blackheart, a ruthless bandit leader. I went in there with twenty men. I left with five. Vitellus Donton wasn't one of them. He died covering our retreat. I snooped around. Apparently, the Blackwood Company completed that contract for us. I went in there with twenty good men. I can't believe that bunch finished the job. There's more. Argoth -- he's dead, the artifact gone. Sounds like a set-up. Maybe they made a deal with Blackheart. I don't know. But I'll find out.\nNow we find out what really happened. And we let it be known. I want to show the people who the Blackwood Company really are. I can't order you do this with me. It's dangerous, and Vilena Donton isn't going to know about it. It's your choice.\nIf you accept this mission, we leave as soon as you're ready. I want to investigate Blackheart's stronghold at Arpenia. Meet me at the Leyawiin guild hall. We'll go from there."

But they are no match for Legionnaires.\nYou are the best and the brightest warriors in Tamriel. Professional soldiers, fearless and devastating. The Emperor will be paying close attention to what happens here today. Men who distinguish themselves will be well rewarded.\nReady now! Everyone, with me! For the Empire! For the Legion!"

I beg of you to help a humble wizard! At first, I suspected Hectan... he is well known about town for his sticky fingers. But after questioning many witnesses, it is clear that Hectan was at the local pub from dusk until dawn the night of the theft. I still suspect that no-good thief Hectan was involved \u2014 I can clearly see the guilt in his face! But there is no proof. Without my spellbook, I am virtually powerless to pursue this myself, and as a newcomer to this town, I have no one to turn to for help.\nI regret that there is little else I can tell you. Hectan can usually be found in the Tankard Tree if you wish to question him.\nI urge you godspeed."

Determine if there are any Ezrohir scouts there... and if you find any, deal with them."

My men have been scouring the city trying to find the culprit, but so far to no avail. People have begun to get scared, and very few are willing to leave their homes at night. Something has to be done, and quickly. Would you be willing to take the job? I'd pay you 300 gold in advance with a 1,000 gold bonus if you discover what's been happening with the disappearing citizens.\nYour job is really simple. All I want you to do is patrol the east of the city and find an entrance to the sewers. Perhaps you'll get lucky and find out what's been happening. If you do find out what's been happening, come to see me at the Flaming Fist barracks. Our only clue so far has led us to the sewers, so if you want to explore them first, it would probably be a good idea. Also, we've found tracks of some many-legged creature, perhaps a centipede-like monster."

I think if we had some of the sap from the parent tree, Eldergleam, we could wake up its child. But even if you could get to the Eldergleam, you couldn't tap it. Not with any normal metal. If you want to help, you'll need something to cut into it first.\nEldergleam is older than metal, from a time before men or elves. To even affect it, you have to tap into the old magic. You'll have to deal with the Hagravens. I've heard about a weapon they've made for sacrificing Kynareth's creations. It's called \"Nettlebane.\" The hags terrify me, or I would have gone after it myself. It's held in a Hagraven nest called Orphan Rock"

Weapons in particular. Last I knew, she was out in the Reach, convinced she was about to find the biggest dwarven ruins yet. You'll also want to find Gunmar. Big brute of a Nord, hates vampires almost as much as I do. Got it into his head years back that his experience with animals would help. Trolls in particular, from what I hear.\nIf you can find them, we might have a chance."

His specialty is setting the Great Forest to canvas. The paintings look so amazingly real that some say they can see the trees sway in the breeze. That's a silly notion of course, but it just goes to show the attention to detail Rythe uses when he paints.\nRythe likes to work in his studio with the door locked, so no one can disturb him. He usually comes out to eat dinner and sleep, but two days ago, he didn't come out at all. At first, I wasn't worried. He does that occasionally. But when he didn't come out for a full day, I unlocked the studio with the key he said to use only in emergencies. It turned out he wasn't inside! I'm sure he never left that room. So I have no idea where he's gone.\nPlease. Help me find Rythe. I love him dearly, and I am so worried. Here's the key to Rythe's studio. You may come and go as you please. If you need me, I'll be around the house."

Go now to Castle Dour in Solitude. Present the Gourmet's Writ of Passage to the officer in charge, Commander Maro.\nYou'll gain unrestricted access to the kitchens, and then the Emperor. You're posing as a chef, so you'll be able to poison his meal rather easily. Here, take this - it's called jarrin root. All it takes is one taste, and the effects are quite immediate. The Emperor will be serving Sithis before he even knows he's dead. Once Mede has been killed, escape through the upper door, and across the bridge. I've \"arranged\" for it to be unguarded once the alarm is sounded.\nNow go, my friend. Go, and fulfill your destiny as Listener."

If the Companions would hunt in the name of their lord, Hircine, we would be granted great power.\nThe Companions of old became werewolves. They did not believe the change would be permanent. The witches offered payment, like anyone else. But we had been deceived. The disease, you see, affects not just our bodies. It seeps into the spirit. Upon death, werewolves are claimed by Hircine for his Hunting Grounds. For some, this is a paradise. They want nothing more than to chase prey with their master for eternity. And that is their choice. But I am still a true Nord. And I wish for Sovngarde as my spirit home.\nI've spent my twilight years trying to find a cure myself. And now I've found the answer. The witches' magic ensnared us, and only their magic can release us. They won't give it willingly, but we can extract their foul powers by force. I want you to seek them out. Go to their coven in the wilderness. Strike them down as a true warrior of the wild. And bring me their heads. The seat of their abilities. From there, we may begin to undo centuries of impurity."

Taken from Big Head, never returned. That is when Big Head came here. Master brought me! Whispered shouts into my ear! Songs of Madgods! Songs of bad gods! Softly, Master. Softly.\nIt went away. But it will come back! It always comes back! It is close. Big Head can hear it! The Fork of Horripilation! Hear it singing! Songs of home! It comes again. It brings presents! It is not present. Soon it will be! You will find it! Bring the Fork! Hear the music. Music of toads. Music of roads! Sing to yourself, so all can hear!\nTalk to the beggar! Talk to Bolwing! He knows secrets, but no one can hear them. No one but Big Head. Take Big Head's charm! Listen to Bolwing! His tongue is tied, but his mind is unraveled! He'll tell you the secret. Who has the Fork?"

There should be one in the Scrapworks, but it was too dangerous for us to enter. Perhaps you will have more luck."
