Now I can't fashion remedies for our villagers, and the next shipment will not be here for a long time.\nYou are a good person. I ask you to find a bundle of life-saving potion ingredients for me. That would mean a lot for the whole village! The bundle should be in the sunken ship east of here. Here, this potion of water breathing should help you dive to the ship save and sound.\nI'll even let you have my old, extra brewing stand as a gift upon your return. Be careful while you dive; there a many lethal things lurking beneath the waves. I'd hate to bury a friend."

The guests believe there is a chest of gold hidden in the house, and have agreed to be locked inside until one of them finds it. In fact, the guests believe the key to the manor is inside the chest, and only by satisfying their greed will they be allowed to leave. Poor fools. There is, of course, no chest of gold. The guests will find no key. After you arrive, the doors will be locked behind you, as everyone expects. When all the guests lie dead, you will be free to leave.\nNow go, see the doorman at Summitmist Manor. He will explain the rest. Have fun."

I've ordered an extra ration of mead, but unless this fighting stops, we'll tear ourselves apart.\n\n11th of First Seed, 4E 201\nRumor is that Herd's gathering followers for a mutiny. Brodir's not stupid; he's probably doing the same, just for insurance. I'd kill them both myself, but the camp's split right down the middle. If I tried, there'd be a knife in my back within a week.\nI can't take this anymore. I've begun skimming a little gold from the take, bringing it down here when I can. If I can scrape enough together, I'll make a run for it, head downriver to Dragon Bridge.\n\n28th of First Seed, 4E 201\nBrodir's getting suspicious -- I caught him poking around in the cove this afternoon. I don't think he found my stash, but it's not safe here. I took the boat out tonight and stowed it on the island to the south, by the old tree stump.\nHad a good haul this week. Another caravan or two and I can finally get out of here, and not a moment too soon."

I really do. He wasn't the man I met seven years ago. The few times I tried to say something, he'd strike me or push me away. I began to become frightened of him.\nOur last score was a tax shipment being delivered to the Imperial City. We robbed it, and in the midst of the chaos, Jorundr killed a guard. I was mortified. We snatched up the gold and holed up in the mountains. He said if I breathed a word of the murder to anyone, he'd kill me. I was terrified of him at this point. Two days later, the Bruma City Guard traced us to our makeshift campsite. I was off gathering food, but Jorundr was captured. Served him right. When I went back to the site later, the gold was gone! He'd moved it! What I need you to do is go to the Bruma Castle Dungeons and speak to him for me. Convince him to tell you where the gold is and then we split it."

Hmm, could you, in fact, imagine just how long I've been waiting? I don't think you could, but I might be wrong.\nIt felt like rather a long time, but then long times get longer when you're standing around thinking about them. A curious thing, that. Long roads get longer too, if you're thinking about them, but what about long words? They don't change nearly as much. Long, short -- it all ends up the same. Dust and tears. Usually tears first, then the dust. Dust can't cry, you see. That would be... well, amusing. You know what's NOT amusing? I don't have my Chalice of Reversal. It makes me sad. When I get sad, I don't care to do much of anything. I certainly don't care to help people who show up on my doorstep wanting something. Are we getting the picture here?\nThe Chalice of Reversal is one of my favorite toys. Does wonders for creativity. Well, not by itself, but it helps. Is this making sense? Look, you eat the Felldew, then use the chalice, and find the world a much brighter and happier place. Honest. But I don't have it. So I can't eat Felldew, because that would just be bad. I mean, really bad. Find my chalice!"

I've invested a great deal of time and money acquiring these bits of ancient history. In fact, I'd be so bold as to proclaim my collection the most complete in all Cyrodiil; perhaps even beyond. Except for one thing.\nA particular relic has eluded me for many years. Possessing this piece of Akaviri antiquity would make my collection complete. I'm of course referring to The Draconian Madstone. The stone is a fine bit of Akaviri craftsmanship. Worn like an amulet, this talisman is said to protect the wearer from poisons of any type. The talisman appears as a snake coiled around and encircling itself. The eyes of the snake are supposed to be precious gems or some such. Through my sources, I've learned that the last reported location of the Draconian Madstone was the ruins at Pale Pass.\nIf you retrieve the Draconian Madstone for me, I'll be happy to compensate you by rewarding you with another Akaviri artifact. Are you in the game?\nLet me tell you how you're going to find the talisman. I've come into the possession of a diary written by an Akaviri messenger. I suspect that the text within can lead you to the ruins. Here's a translation of the passages we could still read. It was quite damaged. I've also included a rough map that was drawn in the diary as well. I'm also providing you with a unique key that was supposedly found with the diary. I'm assuming it will prove useful when you arrive at the site."

She was responsible for the Empire's near collapse almost five hundred years ago. I believe I have a book about her...\nAnd now Potema has been summoned in spirit form. Summoned in spirit form is not raised from the dead. She'll need help before she can return to the living.\nFor the moment, the Wolf Queen has retreated to a place filled with dead eager to serve her. She has gone to her old Catacombs. A few days ago, one of her servants busted through a wall into the Temple of Divines. We'll need you to go into the Catacombs themselves.\nYou were there when Potema was summoned. Being at the summoning created a connection to Potema, you are the one to stop her from returning to the living. I can provide you with some help with her minions.\nAs to Potema herself, find what's left of her body, likely a skeleton. Remove it from the Catacombs and bring it back to be sanctified by Arkay."

We are going to steal one of the Elder Scrolls from the Imperial Palace. Are you ready for this challenge?\nThere is no buyer. This is for glory, not for money. Our names will become legend. I also have a personal need for this particular scroll. As for your compensation, I ask you to trust me. If my plan works, you will get a reward worth far more than mere money.\nI have worked for eleven years planning this heist. Savilla's Stone provided the last bit of information I needed. The Elder Scrolls are kept in the Imperial Palace behind a door that cannot be breached. Savilla's Stone has revealed a path around this door. You will have to travel the Old Way. Once used as an escape route for Imperial Emperors, it has been forgotten for centuries.\nThe Old Way can be found in the Imperial Sewers. Here is the key for the gate to that section of the sewers. My scrying with Savilla's Stone has provided clues, but not the details. I know the tools you will need there, but not the obstacles themselves. The Boots of Springheel Jak will allow you to leap to an unreachable place. They will also protect you from a long fall. The Arrow of Extrication is the only way to unlock the final door. Take them both.\nOnce you are inside the Palace itself, you need to find the reading room. The blind priests will deliver a scroll to you there. I arranged for the notable Celia Camoran to want to read a particular Elder Scroll. Don't ask how. However, she will be... unavoidably detained. You will take her place. Do not speak to the priests. They are blindfolded and will not realize it isn't her unless you speak. As the guildmaster, I am waiving bloodprice for anyone you kill during this heist. However, I can't stop the Watch from putting a price on your head.\nI have written it all down for you in this book. I've chosen you because you are the best. Good luck."

There is one way you can get to him.\nRoenall is quite corrupt and more than willing to exercise his power. You are not monitored as we, so you can do something that I or another guard cannot.\nLook to the docks and a man named Barg. Examine him and what he does, and you are sure to see what I mean. You might also wish to pry into Roenall's personal records. They may reveal something of his fondness for gems. I did not tell you this... and I certainly did not say his records are in his home northwest of the main government building in the Government District.\nThink on what I've said, and bring anything you learn to Corgeig Axehand in the Government District main building. He is Roenall's commander."

It's just a flute. A really old and valuable flute, but just a flute. I just got a ransom note for it. That flute has been handed down for seventeen generations!\nWell don't just stand there. Go get my flute! I don't have any money to give you. but I can show you a few tricks I learned playing for wizards."

We just discovered the traitor was a young man named Mateo. There's no doubt in my mind that *someone* betrayed us. The enemy came through a small sewer outlet that was protected by both a locked iron grate and several powerful magical wards. There is no way to open that entrance from the outside. But Mateo is a faithful soldier, not the type of man to betray Saradush.\nAn alarm was raised, and my soldiers arrived only a few moments after the gate was opened. We found three soldiers in the area: Mateo, Ardic Santele, and the merchant Kiser Jhaeri. We didn't get a chance to complete our investigations. Ardic, the son of the Countess Santele, disappeared. He was our primary witness. Our attention was focused on the vile Kiser Jhaeri, but we had no proof. Then the countess told us that Ardic, her son, had implicated Mateo before he disappeared.\nIf you wish to investigate further, I will not stand in your way. Speak to Mateo in his cell. The jailer will let you see him."

They sent it back to me recently, but it never arrived.\nThe Folio was aboard the \"Strident Squall\" or something like that. The damn thing sunk right off the coast of Solstheim. Can you imagine? One of the sailors survived. Poor thing crawled all the way to Raven Rock on his hands and knees. Before he died, he told the guard about the wreck and warned us that it was going to be crawling with reavers.\nCould you find the Folio for me? You have no idea how much it hurts losing such a precious item!"

I've no doubt now that it hides the entrance to Kvenel's tomb.\nThe two keys must be hidden somewhere nearby - ceremonial replicas of Okin and Eduj, favored weapons when Kvenel went into battle. I don't dare explore further without hiring bodyguards to accompany me, however. To think - The Tongue Chieftain Kvenel could be entombed behind just a few feet of stone! The ancestor we scarcely believed was real.\nTwice damned for planning this foolish scouting trip. I should have hired those sellswords in the first place. Perhaps there's no need. This place is just a tomb, after all, and there are no obvious signs of habitation. It isn't as though the thousand-year dead will mind if I have a look around."

If the stories about the staff are true, if it really can absorb a tremendous amount of power, maybe we can break through Ancano's magic.\nYou know that the staff is in Labyrinthian? Are you... Are you sure? The staff is there? That can't be a coincidence. The Arch-Mage. Before... before he died. He... He gave me something just a little while ago. He told me it was from Labyrinthian, and that I would know what to do with it when the time came. I think... I think he meant this for you, then. I'm not sure why, but there was something very personal about it for him. Also, I think you should take this amulet. It belonged to Savos, but I think would do you the most good now. Take it, and get out of here.\nBring back that staff before Ancano brings the whole College down around us. If we can't stop this, what happens to the rest of Skyrim?"

Something has to be done, and quickly. Would you be willing to take the job? I'd pay you 300 gold in advance with a 1,000 gold bonus if you discover what's been happening with the disappearing citizens.\nYour job is really simple. All I want you to do is patrol the east of the city and find an entrance to the sewers. Perhaps you'll get lucky and find out what's been happening. If you do find out what's been happening, come to see me at the Flaming Fist barracks. Our only clue so far has led us to the sewers, so if you want to explore them first, it would probably be a good idea. Also, we've found tracks of some many-legged creature, perhaps a centipede-like monster."

And, since the assignment is a bit far for Morrowind's Morag Tong to handle, the Dark Brotherhood has been commissioned to perform the elimination.\nBe warned, Silencer! Shaleez is a skilled and deadly hunter, and will fight like the desperate fugitive she is.\nAfter Shaleez has been eliminated, your reward and another contract will be waiting at the dead drop located in a coffin, just outside the ruins of Fort Redman."

Now the Legion's pig's years of service have come to an end. He has retired. Phillida must not be allowed such a victory! His destiny is... darker. Phillida now resides in Leyawiin, in the City Watch barracks, an honored guest of the soldiers there. He is, in fact, more vulnerable than ever.\nThe Black Hand has sanctioned the Rose of Sithis. It is a magic arrow specifically enchanted to kill its target. In this case, Phillida. As long as the arrow hits Phillida, he will die. But it cannot pierce armor! Shoot while Phillida is armored, and the Rose will be wasted. Travel to Leyawiin. Track Phillida. Learn his schedule. Observe when he removes that blasted Legion armor! And then, let fly the Rose of Sithis! Kill Phillida in any way, Rose or not, and the contract is complete. But to receive a bonus, you must go beyond murder. You must send a message! Once Phillida is dead, take the very finger from his corpse, the one that bears an Imperial Legion signet ring! Deposit this finger in the desk of Phillida's successor, in his office in the Prison Barracks, in the Imperial City! Do this, and the bonus is yours."

He's been staying at a place called the Low Lantern. It's the playground for the wicked and depraved, a ship where prostitutes ply their trade. All I want you to do is find him and take his spellbook. I have enough magical skill to reverse the curse if I had the formula for his spell."
