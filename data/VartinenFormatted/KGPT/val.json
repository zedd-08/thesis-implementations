But after questioning many witnesses, it is clear that Hectan was at the local pub from dusk until dawn the night of the theft. I still suspect that no-good thief Hectan was involved \u2014 I can clearly see the guilt in his face! But there is no proof. Without my spellbook, I am virtually powerless to pursue this myself, and as a newcomer to this town, I have no one to turn to for help.\nI regret that there is little else I can tell you. Hectan can usually be found in the Tankard Tree if you wish to question him.\nI urge you godspeed."

At least nothing I'm aware of. Well... If I'm being honest, I haven't exactly been discreet lately in expressing my frustration with this whole situation. Obeying the Night Mother. You being the Listener. It's ridiculous. No offense. Cicero may have overheard me talking to one of the others about the Night Mother. It's possible I was... not entirely respectful. But to go this far. To attempt to murder the leader of a Sanctuary. Cicero must pay with his life. There is no other option.\nI want you to find that miserable little fool and end his life! But first... find my husband. Make sure he's all right. After the attack, Arnbjorn flew into a rage. When Cicero left... Arnbjorn went after him. They disappeared into the wild. Take my horse, Shadowmere. You'll find him outside, by the pool, when you go find Arnbjorn. Search Cicero's room here. Maybe there's something in there that sheds some light on where he might have gone.\nLet me know the minute you find something. I've got to see to Veezara, and calm everyone down."

            "description": "I am merely spirit, but I mean you no harm. In life, I was an ambitious thief, and I thought I was invincible. My greatest achievement was when I stole the Glyph of Balthazar from the Wellspring Basin. I thought I could master its power over water, but I was very, very wrong.\nNow I am trapped here in eternal torment, drowning forever, unable to rectify my mistake. Will you return the Glyph of Balthazar to the Wellspring Basin, and set my spirit free at last?"
