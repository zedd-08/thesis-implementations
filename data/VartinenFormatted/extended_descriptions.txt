Dead Drop Orders #6
by Lucien Lachance

Alval Uvani is dead, just like all the others. You continue to impress me, Silencer, and I am only too eager to indulge your homicidal instincts.
Your next target is a savage Nord barbarian, living alone and exposed at a small campsite on the summit of Gnoll Mountain. This barbarian, Havilstein Hoar-Blood by name, savagely butchered the chieftain of a mead hall on the island of Solstheim. The chieftain's sister has forgone the Nord custom of extracting the monetary retribution of wergild, and instead wants Hoar-Blood to pay with his life. You, dear Silencer, will help put her family at peace.
You are to go to Gnoll Mountain, locate Havilstein Hoar-Blood, and send his soul to the great beyond.
When Hoar-Blood has been executed, journey to the ancient ruin of Nornal. In the flooded section of that ruin you will find a chest, submerged in the water. As you may have guessed, the chest contains your reward for killing Havilstein Hoar-Blood, 500 gold, and your next contract.

You will retrieve this ring for me. Should you manage to do so, I shall consider sending a recommendation to the Arcane University.
The well is locked, so you'll need the key. Deetsan should have a copy of it. Now get moving.

It all started when Aleron became foolish, and started gambling. He'd visit the arena every week and spend our hard earned money on bets. I told him to stop, but he didn't listen. He was certain he could win us a fortune and move us somewhere nicer, like the Imperial City. It didn't take long for Aleron to begin losing. He resorted to borrowing money from a usurer to cover his losses and place new bets. As you can imagine, it didn't pay off. He ended up owing around 500 gold. We could never have that kind of money to pay back the usurer.
Yesterday, the usurer, Kurdan gro-Dragol, sent for my husband to meet him at the Lonely Suitor Lodge. He hasn't returned since. I fear for his life. Kurdan isn't known for his patience. Please, I'm not wealthy, but I'd give anything to see Aleron again. Please, find Aleron.

Good luck... you'll need it.

At first things were going well. He prayed at all the shrines, and received a vision. A disturbing vision. "The shade of Sir Berich spoke to me," was all he said. "We must put him to rest." He said that Sir Berich's tomb was in Underpall Cave -- which is no cave, but some kind of buried keep.
He had learned that Sir Berich had once been a questing knight, like us. He had found the Greaves and Sword of the Crusader, but then turned to evil. Sir Roderic hoped to find the Relics within Sir Berich's tomb. And he did. But we also found a terrible guardian -- the wraith of Sir Berich.

I'm Tivela Lythandas. I apologize that I can't give you the respect a guest in my home would normally receive, but I am at my wit's end. I am sorry to be so forward, but I desperately need your help. It seems that my husband, Rythe, has gone missing, and I just don't know what to do.
Rythe is known far and wide as one of the best painters in all Cyrodiil. His specialty is setting the Great Forest to canvas. The paintings look so amazingly real that some say they can see the trees sway in the breeze. That's a silly notion of course, but it just goes to show the attention to detail Rythe uses when he paints.
Rythe likes to work in his studio with the door locked, so no one can disturb him. He usually comes out to eat dinner and sleep, but two days ago, he didn't come out at all. At first, I wasn't worried. He does that occasionally. But when he didn't come out for a full day, I unlocked the studio with the key he said to use only in emergencies. It turned out he wasn't inside! I'm sure he never left that room. So I have no idea where he's gone.
Please. Help me find Rythe. I love him dearly, and I am so worried. Here's the key to Rythe's studio. You may come and go as you please. If you need me, I'll be around the house.

 I am Sir Ralvas. I am a ghost of a knight. Leyawiin is a location. Leyawiin is a city.  is a location. 
You have my, Sir Ralvas', tribute, sir knight. In three hundred years, none have passed the gauntlet. In three hundred years, we have never known hope. But for the first time, it seems that someone may succeed where we have failed. I see in you the chance to redeem our souls and restore the order. And now, I must ask you to press forward where I could not. I must ask you to face the challenge of Zenithar.
I was arrogant and foolhardy. I sought personal glory. I placed my own will and my own lust for fame over the will of the Nine. In facing the challenge of Zenithar, I failed. I tried dozens -- no, hundreds of times to reach the Mace. I fell each time. And each time I awoke in the chapel, I leaped again. I tried to enlist the help of the other knights, but none would come to my aid. The inscription says to "walk in the faith" but even now, I do not know what this means.
Below the Chapel of Zenithar in Leyawiin there is a shrine to the great craftsman, Saint Kaladas. Those seeking the Mace must pray before the shrine. When you bow, you will receive a vision -- or perhaps not. It is unclear. The priests saw that my body never moved, but it felt so real. You will see the Mace of Zenithar, separated from you by a great chasm. The chasm represents your doubt. Your faith must be your guide across it.
This is what I know. As I said, my faith was weak. I did not understand the test and I fell from the platform each time I tried to cross. I have told you all that I know. All that is left is for you to prove yourself more worthy than I. If you seek the Mace, travel to Leyawiin's chapel, kneel at the shrine in the undercroft, and let your faith in the Nine be the salvation of us all.

Excuse me. I'm innkeeper Diram Serethi. We have a small problem that we hope you can help us with.
You may be wondering why you can't see me. We are all wondering the same thing. Everyone in Aleswell suddenly became invisible several weeks ago. It was sort of fun at first, but the novelty has definitely worn off now. You can imagine how difficult it is to run an inn while invisible. Once you get a reputation as a haunted inn, you can just forget about it. So we've all been keeping quiet, hoping the spell will wear off. But we're running out of patience. We're sure it was Ancotar's doing, but we can't find him. If you can help us, we will be extremely grateful.
Ancotar's a wizard who took up residence in the ruins of Fort Caractacus a couple of years ago. He's caused us no end of trouble with his magical experiments, but nothing as bad as this. We've tried to find him, but had no luck. If he's still living in the fort, he's hiding from us, and no wonder. If you could find him and get him to remove this cursed invisibility, we will all be in your debt. The ruined fort is just to the southeast of here. Follow the path down the hill. But watch out for the invisible monsters that infest the ruins!
If you make us visible again, you'd be welcome at the Aleswell Inn anytime. Free of charge.

These stupid scamps are driving me crazy! I'm at my wit's end! I, Rosentia Gallenus, beg you to help me!
The beastly little creatures are nasty, smelly, noisy and wrecking my beautiful house! I must be rid of them! I can't let people know I have scamps in here, or they'll think I've taken to Daedra worship. Try explaining that to the town guard.
I had a feeling buying that Daedric Staff would be trouble. Now I'm paying for it with more than just some gold. A few weeks ago, a spellsword was passing through Leyawiin and heard that I like to buy curiosities. He wanted to sell the staff you see me carrying. I eagerly bought it, knowing the value of Daedric relics. In fact, I was a bit suspicious when he sold it so cheap. His loss, my gain I figured. After examining it for a bit I noticed a small word carved on it in runes. Using a book from my library, I translated it. The word was nonsense. However, when I spoke it and held the staff, four scamps suddenly appeared! I thought I was done for! Strangely, they all just stood there. It didn't take long before I realized they were following me! I couldn't be seen in town with scamps following, so I decided to discard the staff. I can't explain it, but somehow I can't compel myself to actually let it go. This staff is obviously cursed! Now I'm stuck with it.
Oh please, I beg you! Take this staff to Darkfathom Cave and get rid of it and the scamps forever! I can't fight, and who knows what's guarding the shrine? Plus, do you know how dirty caves are? It'll ruin anything I wear!
Do this for me, and I'll reward you with another one of my curios I picked up a few years ago... a valuable ring. Ring of Eidolon's Edge.

I'm selling my grandfather's house, Benirus Manor. If you're interested, I could let you have it for a modest sum, 5,000 gold. I have to sell it soon, as I have pressing matters elsewhere. You're welcome to take a look at it. It is located across the street from the Chapel.
Once you buy, you get the key to the front door and the deed of ownership. That's the deal.

Do you like parties? Because you've been invited to one. Of course you'll be killing all the other guests. Each guest, at some point in the past, wronged their mysterious host. Now he's hired us to exact his revenge. Are you ready to attend?
You need to go to the city of Skingrad, to the large house known as Summitmist Manor. There you will meet up with five very unlucky guests. In order to receive your bonus, you must kill each guest secretly, one by one. If anyone sees you committing murder, the bonus is forfeit. The guests believe there is a chest of gold hidden in the house, and have agreed to be locked inside until one of them finds it. In fact, the guests believe the key to the manor is inside the chest, and only by satisfying their greed will they be allowed to leave. Poor fools. There is, of course, no chest of gold. The guests will find no key. After you arrive, the doors will be locked behind you, as everyone expects. When all the guests lie dead, you will be free to leave.
Now go, see the doorman at Summitmist Manor. He will explain the rest. Have fun.

Bjalfi snatched Rockshatter from our mantle and took off to "find his fortune" with the local Marauder gang at Fort Strand. I want that mace back. Please, I don't think he's ever coming back, and I'd hate to lose such a precious heirloom to a gang of thugs.

Greetings. I'm Nerussa. I'm quite fond of collecting all manners of wines from all over Tamriel. But one vintage continues to elude me: Shadowbanish Wine. How I'd love to add it to my collection.
Apparently the wine is so rare because it was only made in one tiny batch. It's the product of an alchemist who was also a vintner. Besides tasting incredible, the magic within the wine allows the imbiber to be gifted with Night Eye! The vintner made it special for the Legion soldiers posted at the forts when they were active long ago. It was perfect for keeping lookouts warm on cold nights and helping them see better in the dark.
If you can retrieve six bottles of Shadowbanish Wine, I'll gladly pay you well: 1,000 gold. All I know about them is that they're found in the many fort ruins scattered all over Cyrodiil.

About two days ago, Count Indarys's son, Farwil, entered the Oblivion Gate with six other men. We haven't heard from them since then. The Count fears the worst, and has posted guards here so we can watch and see if anyone comes back out. So far, nothing.
At this point, Count Indarys is offering a reward for the recovery of his son from inside the gate... or confirmed news of his demise. If you find him or the rest of the Knights of the Thorn, get them out of there. I'm sure that the Count would also be pleased if the gate was closed.
The Knights of the Thorn are a bunch of rabble who fancy themselves true knights. Farwil formed the group around two years ago. They make grand boasts, and talk a good talk, but that's all they are. The real work goes to us, the City Guard. I hate to speak ill of them, as something horrible may have happened, but their own bravado got them into this mess.

Ah! Our newest member. I'm glad you stopped by. I have a... situation that you might be able to help with.
The Gray Fox has asked me to take care of a problem, and I'm putting you on it. Hieronymus Lex actually collected taxes from everyone living here on the Waterfront! Your job is to recover those taxes.
The people of the waterfront are very poor. Traditionally the city has not collected taxes from them, even though by law they could. The money the city would collect would barely cover the cost of collecting. The Gray Fox has always guaranteed protection to the poor of the waterfront. He doesn't want to let this injustice stand. It's a matter of principle.
Find out where Hieronymus Lex is keeping the taxes and bring them to me. I'll also need the tax records of what each citizen paid so we can return it.

Selling all sorts of merchandise, Thoronir undercuts prices like you wouldn't believe. He doesn't always sell what we sell, but it is still a problem. People who buy tend to want to spend their money there. That leaves none for us. It's getting so bad, a few of us may have to close up shop. He outright refuses to join the Society or even discuss the matter. We are convinced he is up to no good.
What we need is for you to case his establishment, and figure out where he gets his inventory. Find some proof of his wrongdoing, and let us know. We cannot do it ourselves, as he recognizes all of us. The job pays a fair bounty in gold when he is brought to justice.

I'm sorry. We've not met. I'm Janus Hassildor, Count of Skingrad. I understand you're looking for a cure for vampirism. This is fortunate, as I also seek the cure.
I wish to tell you a story so that you might understand why I would trust you with my secrets. More than 50 years ago, my wife Rona and I were both turned into vampires. While I came to embrace the changes in myself, she did not. She hated what she had become, and refused to feed to keep herself healthy. She eventually slipped into a coma from which she has not awoken. My trusted servants have cared for her all this time, but I wish for her to at last find peace. The cure is for her. I have researched what I can, but acquiring the cure is beyond my grasp. I cannot risk drawing too much attention to myself. So I would ask that you took up the search on my behalf. If you are successful, I will reward you in whatever small way I can. Will you aid me?
What little I have discovered points to the witches of Glenmoril. In the past, they have been capable of creating a cure. I have searched for these witches throughout Cyrodiil, but no covens still exist within its borders. There may be one left. I have unconfirmed reports of a woman seen near the Corbolo river, who fits the description of these witches. Seek her out, and learn whether she can help. She lives somewhere along the river, east of the Imperial City and south of Cheydinhal. If you are successful in finding a cure, report to my steward. You have my thanks.

The taint of Order appeared only a short time ago, but it has spread quickly. As goes the Font of Madness, so goes the Realm. Soon we will all be serving a new master, Jyggalag.
Somehow the forces of Order have poisoned the Pools of Mania and Dementia that feed the Font. I suspect the traitor Thadon. Jyggalag has never had an original thought in his existence. Be that as it may. You will have to enter the Fountainhead beneath the Tree and find the source of the poison.

 I am Sir Casimir. I am a ghost of a knight. Chorrol is a location. Chorrol is a city. 
I, Sir Casimir, know where you may find the Gauntlets of the Crusader, for I was the one who lost them when I was still alive. Though many know where they are, they are still lost. I believe there is something you must do in order to retrieve them.
When the Order fractured, I followed Sir Berich into war, taking the Gauntlets with me. When it was over, I returned to this land. I attempted to return to the service of the Nine, but the war had changed me. I no longer had sympathy for the weak, or pity for the suffering. In the brief time I was there, I did more to hurt the Chapel of Stendarr than help it. It was there that I was cursed.
A beggar who came to the Chapel each day for help tried my patience one too many times. I lost my temper, and struck him. My blow landed harder than I had intended, and he fell to the floor, dead. Killed in the very Chapel of the God of Mercy. I left the Chapel at once, of course, but the damage was done. I was weak, constantly weary, and lacked the energy to do almost anything.
As proof of the deed, when I struck the poor man the Gauntlets slipped right off my hands and fell to the floor. Heavy as stone, they would not move. None could lift them. I suspect they lie there still, in Chorrol's Chapel. You must prove to Stendarr you are worthy to lift the Gauntlets once more. Seek out the priests of Stendarr in Chorrol. Perhaps they can help you.

Sheogorath is gone, but hope is not lost. We have a rare opportunity here, but I hesitate to do what must be done. If the Throne of Madness remains empty when Jyggalag storms the palace, he will prevail. But there is a chance that the throne may not be empty. The only way to protect the Realm from Jyggalag is to place you in the Throne of Madness.
Unfortunately, when Sheogorath faded, the power of the Staff of Sheogorath faded with him. It must now be remade. The Staff is the symbol of power in this Realm. He who rightfully holds the Staff may hold the throne of the Shivering Isles. However, the secrets of its construction are lost.
That which is lost can be found again. There is one being in the Shivering Isles who may be able to assist you in the construction of a new Staff. The ruins of Knifepoint Hollow once served as a great library. There, you will find a door. Behind that door, you will find the answer you seek.
Take this crystal. It contains the power to open the sealed door. Inside, you will find the final remnants of the library. Be mindful of what you find there. The library is a thing of Order, and it will still serve that end.

It's essential. Simply essential! If only it were essentially simple... but it's not. I want him there guarding those Gates. If any of Jyggalag's forces show up, he should be ready for them.
It wouldn't do to just let them in if more show up. And more always show up. Still and all, I think things are going well, considering! Go talk to Relmyna in Xaselm. Tell her you're working for me. She'd do anything for me, that little minx.

They have a plan for me, I see it in their eyes. Caldana, Earil, Cutter, ALL OF THEM!
They don't know I'm up here, watching. Not much longer, though. At least they won't find me or my stash. I've put all my favorite things in an urn, and sunken it in the sewage near the back of Bernice's dive.
I think I'll drink that last bottle to celebrate.

You're going to find out who knows. You're going to learn who keeps secrets, who conspires against me. You will be my Grand Inquisitor. Expose the conspirators, and they will be punished, I assure you. Find out who keeps secrets, and what they are. Speak with Herdir. He will help you. Do you understand what is required of you?

Two of each of us walking around this place. Nothing we can do about it, either. There's a law about that here. Been to the Hill of Suicides? Not a nice place. But you might be able to help.
Only one group can stick around. Either we Demented or those blasted Manics. It's the only way we'll find any peace. You get rid of those Manics. All of them. If you can take care of that for me, I'd make it worth your while..

Jorundr is a male thief, and Arnora Auria's ex-boyfriend. 
Here's the deal. Jorundr and I have had a rocky relationship at best.
Against my will, I've been dragged all over Cyrodiil helping him commit petty crimes. I wouldn't say we're thieves. I mean, we've stolen things... sure. But we've never stolen that much at one time. Just enough to keep us going. That is, until last year.
Jorundr started to take risks and began robbing more dangerous targets. Not just lone merchants, mind you. I'm talking about the bigger scores. Like estates and tax shipments. I begged him to stop, as I knew that his capers would one day lead to violence. He just threatened to... hurt me if I got in his way. I think the gold changed him. I really do. He wasn't the man I met seven years ago. The few times I tried to say something, he'd strike me or push me away. I began to become frightened of him.
Our last score was a tax shipment being delivered to the Imperial City. We robbed it, and in the midst of the chaos, Jorundr killed a guard. I was mortified. We snatched up the gold and holed up in the mountains. He said if I breathed a word of the murder to anyone, he'd kill me. I was terrified of him at this point. Two days later, the Bruma City Guard traced us to our makeshift campsite. I was off gathering food, but Jorundr was captured. Served him right. When I went back to the site later, the gold was gone! He'd moved it! What I need you to do is go to the Bruma Castle Dungeons and speak to him for me. Convince him to tell you where the gold is and then we split it.

This is the big one. This is the heist that will be written about and talked about for decades to come. We are going to steal one of the Elder Scrolls from the Imperial Palace. Are you ready for this challenge?
There is no buyer. This is for glory, not for money. Our names will become legend. I also have a personal need for this particular scroll. As for your compensation, I ask you to trust me. If my plan works, you will get a reward worth far more than mere money.
I have worked for eleven years planning this heist. Savilla's Stone provided the last bit of information I needed. The Elder Scrolls are kept in the Imperial Palace behind a door that cannot be breached. Savilla's Stone has revealed a path around this door. You will have to travel the Old Way. Once used as an escape route for Imperial Emperors, it has been forgotten for centuries.
The Old Way can be found in the Imperial Sewers. Here is the key for the gate to that section of the sewers. My scrying with Savilla's Stone has provided clues, but not the details. I know the tools you will need there, but not the obstacles themselves. The Boots of Springheel Jak will allow you to leap to an unreachable place. They will also protect you from a long fall. The Arrow of Extrication is the only way to unlock the final door. Take them both.
Once you are inside the Palace itself, you need to find the reading room. The blind priests will deliver a scroll to you there. I arranged for the notable Celia Camoran to want to read a particular Elder Scroll. Don't ask how. However, she will be... unavoidably detained. You will take her place. Do not speak to the priests. They are blindfolded and will not realize it isn't her unless you speak. As the guildmaster, I am waiving bloodprice for anyone you kill during this heist. However, I can't stop the Watch from putting a price on your head.
I have written it all down for you in this book. I've chosen you because you are the best. Good luck.

For reasons unknown to this one, the Gray Fox has extended his protection to the Umbranox family and Lady Umbranox in particular. While Lex is a problem for the guild, his unwavering loyalty and resolve make him the perfect protector for Lady Umbranox.
You will have to track down a forger on your own. I don't know of any in Bravil. With the forged letter in hand, sneak into the Legion Commander's office in the Imperial City Prison and seal it with his seal. Dairihill cannot be trusted. You must deliver the letter to Lady Umbranox in person.

Slythe's Journal
by Slythe Seringi

As midnight approaches, I still watch the fires burn. The great city of man, Kvatch, lay in ruins. They didn't heed my words. They didn't listen to my voice. Now, they are all paying the cost of ignorance. The Sunken One strikes swift and hard. He swats those who oppose Him as if they did not exist at all. The excuses of man fall upon deaf ears. The Sunken One has no pity; He has no mercy, He only sits below and passes sentence. And now, with a mighty stroke, He's toppled one of man's pitiful blights on His land. And yet, He still hungers. His appetite is voracious. Kvatch will not be the last city to fall by His hand. The world of man grows more and more corrupt, and it angers Him. Man's lies and deceit will be his undoing as The Sunken One grows impatient and no longer waits for or accepts the proper offering.
The burden is mine to shoulder. I am the last who knows of He Who Shakes The Ground. If I do not bring him the Offering, who knows what city may fall prey to his whim? Anvil? Chorrol? Or perhaps He will turn his eyes on the greatest boil of all, the great Imperial City itself. No, I must not let that happen. I must get the Offering to him like my father did before me. Man may be fallen in His eyes, but they must have time to learn The Sunken One's teachings. Destroying man now would be a waste, when I am certain that given the chance, they will come to see His ways. Yes, I will do this thing. I will brave the depths of Sandstone Cavern to see Him. My weapons will be my will and my word. The Sunken One will watch over me and guide me. I must depart soon, before it is too late. If anyone finds this journal, let them know that I, Slythe Seringi, do this for the good of all man.

Maelona's family heirloom is a small ring. 
I'm Maelona. How would you like to get my husband, Gogan, out of hot water?
Believe me, he'll need all the help he can get to worm his way out of this one. To think he'd fall for the gang's scheme... agh! I could kill him! I'm sorry... I'm rambling and got you confused. Let me explain.
The women in the gang use their wiles to lure men out to some remote location and rob them blind. It's been going on for some time now. The city guard hasn't done very much about it, because frankly, the men who are robbed are so embarrassed, they don't want to report it. Take for example that good-for-nothing husband of mine, Gogan. He cared more about their charms than my own.
When Gogan was, uh... with the women, they took something quite valuable from him. No... it's not what you're thinking. He was carrying a precious family heirloom with him when he was lured out to their lair. It was a small ring given to him on our wedding day. The ring belonged to my mother, and has been in the family for generations. I'm willing to give you all the money I have to get it back. 100 gold. Can you help us?
All I can tell you is that the best place to start is at The Flowing Bowl. It's a tavern located outside the city walls near the waterfront. The Flowing Bowl attracts the worst Anvil has to offer. Always be on your guard.

 I am Fathis Ules. I am a man employing thieves. Weatherleah is a location. Weatherleah is a farmhouse built by Albert Jemane, in the middle of nowhere. Chorrol is a location. Chorrol is a city. Redguard Valley is a location. Redguard Valley is a well-known ogre den. Reynald is present in Weatherleah. Reynald is one of the Jemane brothers. 
Fathis Ules. I may have a bit of a proposition for you involving the Jemane family you so recently assisted.
It was kind of you to escort the Jemanes back to Weatherleah. However, their father, the original owner of Weatherleah left them an even greater legacy.
My tale actually begins with the father, Albert Jemane. He was once in my employ, or should I say the employ of my organization. He was very good at obtaining things from people who did not want to part with. A professional thief, to put it bluntly. He was assigned to obtain a very valuable item for me. He succeeded, but decided to keep this item for himself. An unfortunate decision.
Albert Jemane fled from Chorrol with his family, and was never heard from again. Only his small son Reynald was found, wandering alone in the wilderness. Naturally, my associates and I believed he had perished. The wilderness is, after all, a dangerous place. No place to take your family. Then, these many years later, voila! The brother reappears. It seems the rest of the family did not die in the wilderness after all.
What is the point of my tale? Albert Jemane builds Weatherleah way out in the middle of nowhere. He was a thief, not a farmer. The only reason to establish such a place would be to stay out of the Chorrol Guard's sight. I believe that the item Albert stole, which rightly belongs to me, was hidden at Weatherleah. Unfortunately, the notorious Redguard Valley Ogres ransacked the place and probably took all of the loot back with them.
If you were to obtain this item, somehow, and bring it to me, I would pay you very well for it.

You look like the honest sort, so I've a job for you.
You're going to travel to Cheydinhal, and find out what sort of impostor is trying to besmirch my good name. And you're going to tell him... *hic*...

Another mortal dares to summon me, Sheogorath, and already I am bored. But enough about me. Let's talk about you.
I could turn you into a goat. Or a puddle. Or a bad idea. I could make you eat your own fingers. Or fall in love with a cloud. Perhaps I could make you into something useful. Let's find out.
There's a little settlement called Border Watch. It's a nice, peaceful place... and dull, dull, dull. You're going to make their lives interesting. They're a superstitious bunch. Everything is an omen or a portent. Let's make one come true. Find their shaman and ask about the K'Sharra prophecy. You are to find a way to make the first two parts of the prophecy come true. I'll take care of the rest, because it's the most fun. Now, run along.

I have another job for you. This is not quite in your usual line of work, but I hope you can help me just the same.
A rival collector has an item, the Crown of Nenalata, which I very much want to add to my collection. But she stubbornly refuses to consider any of my offers. She and I have had our differences over the years, I admit. Now she is taking this opportunity to get her revenge. I believe that you may be able to persuade her to part with the item, where I cannot due to her prejudice against me. Her name is Herminia Cinna. She lives here in the Imperial City, in the Elven Gardens district.
I hope you will succeed where I have so far failed. Afterwards, in order to bring my research on the last king of the Ayleids to its final stage, I need to go to the Throne Room of Nenalata. While I am not without means of defending myself, I believe you would be an invaluable companion on such an expedition. Your reward will be whatever plunder you wish to carry off from Nenalata. Since the Throne Room has been sealed since the time of the Ayleids, it should provide rich pickings.

Until you have the message from S'Krivva, we have nothing further to say to one another.

Small volume, but she pays well. Normally I make the deliveries, but I wasn't feeling well so Dar-Ma insisted on going this time. In case it may be useful, she was with Blossom -- her horse, I mean.

Long Forgotten Note
by Daravyn the Gray

My love,
I write this with trembling hands. The guards are after me, and I have nowhere else to turn. Soon they will be at the doors to Rosethorn Hall, and nothing will keep them from taking me away back to that horrible prison. I don't know how they found me; perhaps it was that traitor, Delgariun. Whoever told them I was hiding in your home must have known both of us very well. I know Delgariun has eyes for you, I know he's the one that framed me in the first place and had me sent to that dank hole in the Imperial City. He has to be the one. Beware of him, my love. He's treacherous and only wants you to get to the treasure. I didn't give it up to the guards, and I won't give it up to Delgariun. I've hidden the treasure within the walls of Rosethorn Hall. Remember the toy we played with as we ran through this place as children?
Remember the riddle we had for it? It was our secret code: "Two bodies have I, though both joined in one. The more I stand still, the quicker I run."
The key to the treasure lies with the answer. Take care of it, my love. It is your ticket far from Delgariun. Do not fret, I've escaped once, I shall do so again. Soon we will be together, and the sun will shine upon us.

 I am Sinderion. I am an alchemist. Shadeleaf Copse is a location. Shadeleaf Copse is a part of the Great Forest northeast of here. Nirnroot is an object. Nirnroot is a rare root plant. Elixir of Exploration is an object. Elixir of Exploration is a multi-purpose potion for dungeon explorers. Imperial Alchemy Symposium is an object. Imperial Alchemy Symposium is a convention for alchemists. 
So, you've brought something for me to examine?
Yes, this is a genuine Nirnroot sample. Very nice quality in fact. Hmmm... that gives me an idea. Since you already know what they look like, do you feel up to a bit of a collecting expedition?
A few years ago, an adventurer not unlike yourself sold me a musty old tome containing alchemical formulas. Most of them were worthless. But one of the moldy pages contained the recipe for a potion known as an Elixir of Exploration, a sort of "ultimate dungeon delver's" brew. The formula looked sound, except it required an extremely rare ingredient. Yes, you guessed it, the Nirnroot. I put the book aside, because frankly, I had so many other delicate experiments going on that I just didn't have the time to go plant hunting. Now that you're here, that changes things.
The Elixir of Exploration is a multi-purpose potion that was obviously created with the dungeon explorer in mind. The formula describes many magnitudes of the brew. If you're interested, I wrote a short missive about it for the Imperial Alchemy Symposium. You bring me 10 samples of Nirnroot, and I'll make the Elixir of Exploration available to you at a huge discount as well as give you one for free.
The best place for you to start would be Shadeleaf Copse, which is a part of the Great Forest northeast of here. Good luck, and hurry back with more of the Nirnroot!

Barely a week ago, I left Harm's Folly to go buy supplies as I usually do once a month. What a fool I was to leave my wife alone. The goblins must have been watching me, as they knew right when to strike. I could hear her screams from far away. Those wretched beasts killed her! Filthy animals! Had I only been there to stop them!
I'll tell you how you can help. Go to Exhausted Mine. Kill those goblins. Every last one of them! They destroyed everything I hold dear! In their greed, the creatures grabbed a jade amulet off of Kayleen's... body. Bring me back that amulet, so I may use it to remember her by.
Please, I'll give you six gems as a token of my gratitude. They're all I have left of value, but you must have them if you do the deed.

Now, the details. Far south of here, on the southern end of Cyrodiil, lies a swamp called Bogwater. Hiding in that swamp you will find an Argonian Shadowscale named Scar-Tail. Kill this renegade. and bring me his heart as proof of the deed.
I have some history with Scar-Tail. When Ocheeva and I trained with the Dark Brotherhood as children, we befriended another initiate, a Shadowscale by the name of Scar-Tail. The three of us were inseparable. When our training was completed, we reluctantly parted ways. But now... Now, the unthinkable has happened! Scar-Tail has fled Black Marsh and refuses to fulfill his duties as royal assassin! This is an act of treason! This treachery must be punished! Just as a member of the Dark Brotherhood cannot kill a fellow family member, a Shadowscale is forbidden from slaying another Shadowscale. That is why you must go to Bogwater and eliminate that treacherous snake!
Please kill Scar-Tail, so Ocheeva and I can put this matter behind us.

Ahh yes, THERE you are! You couldn't imagine how long I, Thadon, the Duke of Mania, have been waiting for you. So little to do, and so much time. Hmm, could you, in fact, imagine just how long I've been waiting? I don't think you could, but I might be wrong.
It felt like rather a long time, but then long times get longer when you're standing around thinking about them. A curious thing, that. Long roads get longer too, if you're thinking about them, but what about long words? They don't change nearly as much. Long, short -- it all ends up the same. Dust and tears. Usually tears first, then the dust. Dust can't cry, you see. That would be... well, amusing. You know what's NOT amusing? I don't have my Chalice of Reversal. It makes me sad. When I get sad, I don't care to do much of anything. I certainly don't care to help people who show up on my doorstep wanting something. Are we getting the picture here?
The Chalice of Reversal is one of my favorite toys. Does wonders for creativity. Well, not by itself, but it helps. Is this making sense? Look, you eat the Felldew, then use the chalice, and find the world a much brighter and happier place. Honest. But I don't have it. So I can't eat Felldew, because that would just be bad. I mean, really bad. Find my chalice!

I've been trying to catch Lonavo for months, but every time I approach the place, his lookout sees me and he goes running. I need someone to go in there and put a stop to those fetchers. I don't care what it takes. We must get that poison they're selling off the street.
Bring me Lonavo's ring as proof he's... been dealt with... and I'll give you the bounty on him. Be vigilant. Lonavo is a snake.

My potatoes are like my children. I care for and nurture each one individually. That way, they grow up to be big and strong. How stupid I was to leave them outside all alone like that! All I wanted to do was give them some sun. Next thing I knew, they were gone!

Phillida now resides in Leyawiin, in the City Watch barracks, an honored guest of the soldiers there. He is, in fact, more vulnerable than ever.
The Black Hand has sanctioned the Rose of Sithis. It is a magic arrow specifically enchanted to kill its target. In this case, Phillida. As long as the arrow hits Phillida, he will die. But it cannot pierce armor! Shoot while Phillida is armored, and the Rose will be wasted. Travel to Leyawiin. Track Phillida. Learn his schedule. Observe when he removes that blasted Legion armor! And then, let fly the Rose of Sithis! Kill Phillida in any way, Rose or not, and the contract is complete. But to receive a bonus, you must go beyond murder. You must send a message! Once Phillida is dead, take the very finger from his corpse, the one that bears an Imperial Legion signet ring! Deposit this finger in the desk of Phillida's successor, in his office in the Prison Barracks, in the Imperial City! Do this, and the bonus is yours.

Eliminator,
You have served the Dark Brotherhood well in the short time you have been with us. Indeed, the rate of your advancement has been rather remarkable. Now the Black Hand itself is in need of your abilities.
You must proceed with all haste to my private refuge in the ruins of Fort Farragut, located in the forest northeast of the Cheydinhal Sanctuary. When you arrive, we will discuss the nature of your special assignment.
I cannot stress to you enough the importance of your swift arrival at Fort Farragut. There are unseen powers working to unravel the very fabric of the Dark Brotherhood. The Black Hand is counting on you to prevent this disaster.
Do not share the contents of this message with anyone at the Cheydinhal Sanctuary, including Ocheeva, and make no mention of your journey to Fort Farragut! Also, be warned -- my refuge within Fort Farragut is guarded by denizens who will attack any interloper on sight. Get through these rotting sentinels and you will surely have earned the right to visit my private sanctum.

I believe that Mankar Camoran acts as the "anchor" for Paradise, just as a sigil stone anchors an Oblivion Gate in place. Kill Mankar Camoran, and you will unmake his Paradise.
Farewell, my friend. Our fate is in your hands. Bring back the Amulet of Kings. Brace yourself.

The time has come to test both your skill and your loyalty to Sithis. The Black Hand has learned that the Dark Brotherhood has been infiltrated. By whom, and for what purpose, we do not yet know. What we do know is that there is some link between the traitor and the Cheydinhal Sanctuary. The traitor has tainted that place beyond repair. It was learned that the traitor has been active for quite some time, since before you joined the Brotherhood. That absolves you of any suspicion.
The Black Hand has chosen you to perform the ancient rite known as Purification. Everyone inside the Sanctuary must die! You must break one of the Tenets you have sworn to uphold. I know this is an unexpected turn of events, but drastic measures must be taken. Ocheeva, Vicente Valtieri, Antoinetta Marie, Gogron gro-Bolmog, Telaendril, M'raaj-Dar and Teinaava. All of these family members must die! From this point forward, you are no longer bound by the Five Tenets! Sithis will forgive any murder, any theft, so long as you serve the Black Hand!
When the rite of Purification has been completed, return to me here at Fort Farragut, and we will discuss your future. Now, take these special gifts. They will help you greatly. One is a poisoned apple. The other, a unique scroll of summoning. Good luck... assassin.

It's an honor to finally meet you. When I heard you were in town, I just had to send for your help. Your reputation precedes you. Oh, allow me to introduce myself. I am Seridur.
Welcome. You're now in the sanctuary of the Order of the Virtuous Blood. Few outside our circle have ever set foot in our hallowed hall. We are, for lack of a better word, defenders. We guard this city from an infestation that plagues it. We are vampire hunters. I'm sure you are familiar with those despicable beings. Feeding on the innocent as if they were cattle. Well, this group was formed to combat them. Alas, we are but 3 old men, not able to match the fighting prowess of the vampire. We lack the strength to defeat them in battle.
Our goal is to root out the vampires that live in our fair city. So far, we've been unsuccessful finding one until now. It's come to the Order's attention that Temple District resident Roland Jenseric is a vampire, and has already claimed one victim. That's where you come in. We want you to slay this vampire and cleanse the city of his filth before he can feed or kill again.
A few nights ago, I was roaming the city as I often do, looking for any signs of a vampire. As I headed past Roland's house I heard a cry. I rushed into the back garden to find Roland struggling with a woman he'd been courting. I tried to intervene, but he was too strong. He threw his lover to the ground and turned his attention on me. Luckily, I managed to run back into the street and escape his grasp. I hid for a while and then returned to the garden. Roland was gone and the woman was dead. She had two puncture marks on the nape of her neck. That's when I realized he was a vampire. The Order needs you to track him and destroy him.
I would start by searching his home. He hasn't been there for days, so it should be safe. Return to us here if you have questions. We meet at night.

Today I caught Bernadette Peneles watching me. I have very little doubt now that she is one of them. This saddens me. I had thought her one of the few to show me kindness in this nest of treachery. But now it seems that it was all a lie.
Be outside my house at 6 am, you'll see her watching me. See where she goes and who she reports to. We'll meet here again tomorrow night. Oh, and NEVER contact me in public. They're watching. They can't know you're helping me.

 I am Umbacano. I am a collector of Ayleid artifacts. High Fane is a location. High Fane is an ancient Ayleid settlement known by a different name today. 
You have proven yourself more than a simple grave robber. I believe you can handle a more complicated assignment. Are you interested?
Here, take a look at this sketch. The ancient texts refer to this site only as the "High Fane." Do you know it? Your first task is to locate the ruins of the High Fane. I believe it must now be known by a different name.
The High Fane dates from the Late Ayleid Period, following the fall of White Gold Tower, a very troubled time for that ancient people. A time I find most fascinating. The drawing on the bottom of the page I gave you depicts a carved panel from the central chamber of the High Fane. I believe this carving will shed new light on Ayleid history, if I am able to examine it closely. I would like you to retrieve it for me.
You will need this as well. It is the key to the inner chamber of the High Fane. I part with it reluctantly, so guard it well. It is what began my search for the High Fane, many years ago.

I don't suppose I could convince you to help me recover my research notes? I was doing some research in Bramblepoint Cave, and suddenly I was attacked. I grabbed everything I could and ran, but I fear I dropped my notes. Those notes are very important to me and represent ten years of my life.

Dead Drop Orders #2
by Lucien Lachance

The Necromancer Celedaen is dead, and you are not. That is quite an accomplishment. But your work as a Silencer has just begun.
Your next assignment requires you to eliminate not just one target, but five. An entire family, in fact. The unlucky kin are Perennia Draconis, Matthias Draconis, Andreas Draconis, Sibylla Draconis and Caelia Draconis. The locations of most of the family members are unknown, so you should begin your search with the family matron, Perennia, who resides at the farm called Applewatch.
You must discern the locations of all the Draconis family members and then systematically eliminate them. I suggest you first speak with the mother and find out if she has any valuable information on the whereabouts of her children, before ending her life.
When every member of the Draconis family lies dead, journey to the city of Skingrad. In the castle courtyard you will find a well containing your reward for the Draconis contract, as well any further assignment I might have.

Her expertise in arcane knowledge and lore could be invaluable to us, if we can make proper use of it. She can likely be found in the Archives now, poring through materials on Necromancy. She stops only to sleep, at the Arch-Mage's request.

Your target is a High Elf named Faelian. He lives somewhere in the Imperial City, and fancies long walks. Unfortunately, that's all we know. We don't know which district he calls home, which establishments he frequents, or anything about his schedule.
This contract will require a bit of detective work. I suggest you to speak to your fellow Brothers and Sisters and see if they can offer any advice. Ah yes, there is one more thing. The Imperial City is also home to an Imperial Legion captain named Adamus Phillida. Phillida has dedicated his life to eradicating the Dark Brotherhood. He will not tolerate our operations within the Imperial City.
When that happens, he tends to make our lives uncomfortable. Let's not give the good captain any reason to go poking around in our affairs, hmm? If possible, do away with Faelian someplace out of the way. Definitely indoors, with no other people around. A secure location, with no witnesses. This will make it look like a simple murder. Phillida will be none the wiser, and you'll receive a nice bonus.
Now go, and may the Reaper of Souls go with you.

Dead Drop Orders #5
by Lucien Lachance

If you're reading this note, Shaleez is dead. You've done the world a great service, Silencer. It's time to continue the good work.
Your next target is a traveling Dark Elf merchant by the name of Alval Uvani, who is currently renting a house in the city of Leyawiin. Uvani is a well-respected tradesman back in his native Morrowind, but his business often takes him very far from home. Therein lies the problem. Alval Uvani's wife has become disillusioned with her husband's repeated, extended absences and wishes to dissolve their marriage, and has sought the Dark Brotherhood's assistance. Lucky for us Cyrodiil is a bit beyond the reach of Morrowind's Morag Tong.
Alval Uvani is currently traveling around Cyrodiil, and is never in one place for more than a couple of days. In this dead drop you will also find a schedule detailing the Dark Elf's whereabouts; use it to locate him and plan your elimination. Be aware, however, that because he is forced to travel alone to the farthest reaches of the Empire, Uvani has learned to defend himself. He is a master of the Destruction school of Magicka, and is no stranger to killing.
When Alval Uvani lies rotting, journey to the Market District of the Imperial City. There you will find a shop called Stonewall Shields. Your dead drop is located behind that building, in a hollowed-out tree stump. As usual, you will find your reward for the previous contract, as well as information on your next.
Ah yes, I must mention one last detail. Apparently Alval Uvani suffers from a rare Dark Elf condition, a serious allergy to honey. If you could somehow get Uvani to drink the honey-based mead, perhaps by replacing his food, he would suffer from complete paralyzation. This would certainly make the Dark Elf a bit easier to deal with.

I've got another job for you, slightly off the record. You'll be going on a mission with Viranus Donton. Yes -- the guildmaster's son.
You're to accompany him, and make sure he succeeds. He needs some time in the field, to get his confidence up, or he'll never become a good warrior. Vilena coddles the boy too much. Doesn't want him in the line of fire. Suppose it's no surprise after Vitellus.
Vitellus was Vilena Donton's eldest son. Good man. We lost him on a botched mission recently. You've probably seen the other wounded around. If you're smart, you'll steer clear of the subject around the guildmaster. Perhaps you and I will have time to discuss it more later.
Viranus' mother's been holding him back, protecting him. You'll go to Nonwyll Cavern with him. Galtus Previa was lost there, and you're to find him. And not a word of this to the guildmaster! Go find him. He'll be in the Donton house, most likely. And bring him back in one piece!

Make no mistake: this task is simple, but has a purpose. In selflessly serving the guild, at risk to yourself, while putting your own feelings aside, you prove your devotion to the cause. You will help replenish alchemical supplies for the guild.
Deliver 20 Dragon's Tongue flowers, and 20 Redwort flowers to me. Surprised? Annoyed? It is not unexpected. Nevertheless, that is your path to re-acceptance in the guild.

Everyone is here, let's begin.
Each of you is seeking membership in the Thieves Guild. The Thieves Guild is not a myth. We are followers of the Gray Fox, and I am his Doyen.
Merely by finding me, you have passed the first test. It's unusual for us to have three potential recruits at the same time. Rather than the normal test of skill, I'm going to make this a contest. Methredhel, you know the rules. However, for Amusei and the newcomer, let me state them clearly.
Whoever brings me the diary of Amantius Allectus, without killing him, will be invited into the guild. It's somewhere in the Imperial City. The beggars will help you locate it, for a price. I can sell you lockpicks if you need them.
One more thing. You cannot kill each other during this trial. We may be thieves, but we're not murderers.

Weathered Journal
by Vangaril

Long have I sought to purge the evils haunting Erandur. Even when his necromantic studies resulted in our mutual expulsion from the Guild of Mages, I persisted in guiding him towards good with a gentle hand. Alas, in our exile, my old friend has mired himself in the foul practice, and in shocking discovery I learned he had become a miserly disciple of the Worm King, a cunning wraith. A Lich.
Frail memory strengthened by dogmatic resolve, the Archmages turned me away when I came to them with my discovery. My pleas for a detachment of battlemages ignored, only my long-past expulsion remembered. And thus, the grave duty falls only to me. I must bear the burden of purging the Lich that was once a friend.
I wander now into the foreboding maw of these catacombs known as the Lost Boy Caverns, far from the climes of common elves and men. With pure spirit and rites of cleansing, I hope to strike down the fearsome Lich and set free the soul of Erandur, but I leave this testament behind, lest I may never return from these depths; as a warning to those who may follow my path.
Faithful, even in Exile,
Vangaril

Seek Agata, child. She will see the path, and set you on it. She may be young, but her heart is old and wise. It guides her well through these troubled times.

Weatherleah was our family's home for generations. Our parents fled it when ogres attacked; they became separated. My father carried me to safety. He later returned and believed Reynald and my mother had perished. Since ogres are cannibals, he didn't expect to find their bodies. Thankfully, however, it seems that my mother managed to carry Reynald to safety. While my mother didn't survive, Reynald did, and for that I'm grateful.
But we both want more - we want our home back. We're not fighters; you appear to have more skill than either of us. Would you go to Weatherleah, and see if it's still inhabited by ogres?
Now, we're not quite sure where the estate is located. We'll offer up what we know, however. We believe it's somewhere south of Chorrol, but southwest of Fort Carmala. It may be difficult to find. Since no one's lived there for many years, it may be quite overgrown by now.
If you find Weatherleah, let us know. We'll be waiting anxiously.

 I am Countess Narina Carvain. I am a collector of Akaviri relics. Cyrodiil is a location. Countess Narina Carvain is present in Cyrodiil. Cyrodiil is a location. Cyrodiil is a realm.  is a location. Draconian Madstone is an object. Draconian Madstone is an Akaviri artifact, an amulet that protects its wearer from poisons of any type, looks like a snake coiled around and encircling itself: the eyes of the snake are precious gems. 
Allow me to formally introduce myself. I'm Countess Narina Carvain. I assume you've noticed all of the Akaviri relics I'm displaying.
Well, it's safe to say I'm a collector of sorts. I've invested a great deal of time and money acquiring these bits of ancient history. In fact, I'd be so bold as to proclaim my collection the most complete in all Cyrodiil; perhaps even beyond. Except for one thing.
A particular relic has eluded me for many years. Possessing this piece of Akaviri antiquity would make my collection complete. I'm of course referring to The Draconian Madstone. The stone is a fine bit of Akaviri craftsmanship. Worn like an amulet, this talisman is said to protect the wearer from poisons of any type. The talisman appears as a snake coiled around and encircling itself. The eyes of the snake are supposed to be precious gems or some such. Through my sources, I've learned that the last reported location of the Draconian Madstone was the ruins at Pale Pass.
If you retrieve the Draconian Madstone for me, I'll be happy to compensate you by rewarding you with another Akaviri artifact. Are you in the game?
Let me tell you how you're going to find the talisman. I've come into the possession of a diary written by an Akaviri messenger. I suspect that the text within can lead you to the ruins. Here's a translation of the passages we could still read. It was quite damaged. I've also included a rough map that was drawn in the diary as well. I'm also providing you with a unique key that was supposedly found with the diary. I'm assuming it will prove useful when you arrive at the site.

 I am Arch-Mage Traven. I am the player's guild leader in the Mages Guild. Cyrodiil is a location. Arch-Mage Traven is present in Cyrodiil. Imperial City is a location. Imperial City is a major city. White Rose River is a location. White Rose River is a river. Elsweyr is a location. Elsweyr is a province. Cyrodiil is a location. Cyrodiil is a province. Nenyond Twyll is a location. Nenyond Twyll is a Necromancer lair in ancient ruins, south of the Imperial City, south of the White Rose River, nearly halfway to the border of Elsweyr. Mucianus Allias is present in Nenyond Twyll. Mucianus Allias is a male mage who infiltrated the Necromancers. 
Greetings. It is high time that we met face to face, don't you think? Raminus has told me good things about you. You have advanced quickly, and show great promise. I now intend to put your talents to a more direct test.
I have a difficult task that you can, perhaps, assist with. Let me explain what is at stake. The Council of Mages has been aware of the increased Necromancer activity in Cyrodiil for some time. It had been our position to sit back and watch what unfolded, but that time has clearly passed. We cannot tolerate these attacks on the guild. Most of our information on Necromancers has come from an informant inside the cult itself, a guild member who offered to infiltrate their ranks.
Though the information he has provided is limited, it has given us a sense of their scope and power. The Council was initially reluctant to believe the information was reliable, but with recent events, they have little choice but to trust it. I fear that our informant is in danger, and that is why I have called you here.
The informant is a mage called Mucianus Allias. He is not a Council member, but has long served the guild here at the Arcane University. Aware in the growing interest in the guild after the band of Necromancy was put into place, he offered to help the Council track the cult's actions. With my blessing, he infiltrated the group, and has fed us information for quite some time, until recently. I have not heard from him, and I fear for his safety.
The lack of reports from Mucianus has disturbed the Council, and they are now concerned about the legitimacy of his information. A group of Battlemages were dispatched to Mucianus's last know location, with the intent on bringing him in for questioning. I argued against it, but eventually agreed to maintain order in the Council. I regret that decision, and that is why I wish to send you there. I fear the Battlemages may mistreat Mucianus, if they do not mistake him for one of the many Necromancers no doubt present in the ruins.
I wish for you to find Mucianus, and ensure his safe return to the Arcane University. I do not want anything to go wrong. Please, hurry. The Battlemages will arrive there soon, if they have not already, and time is of the essence. If for any reason they are unsuccessful, Mucianus' life will be forfeit. You must make sure he is safe. Go now, and bring word to me as soon as he has been escorted to safety. Mucianus last reported being sent to the ruins of Nenyond Twyll, south of the Imperial City. That is where the Battlemages went. South of the White Rose River, nearly halfway to the border of Elsweyr. I'm afraid I know nothing more about the location, or what you may expect to find once you arrive.

You sleep rather soundly for a murderer. That's good. You'll need a clear conscience for what I'm about to propose.
I am Lucien Lachance, a Speaker for the Dark Brotherhood. And you, you are a killer. A taker of life. A harvester of souls. Your work, your deathcraft, pleases the Night Mother. And so, I come to you with an offering. An opportunity... to join our rather unique family.
On the Green Road to the north of Bravil lies the Inn of Ill Omen. There you will find a man named Rufio. Kill him, and your initiation into the Dark Brotherhood will be complete. Know that Rufio is old and weak, and sleeps his days away. You could kill him before he even has a chance to wake. If you so choose. Do this, and the next time you sleep in a location I deem secure, I will reveal myself once more, bearing the love of your new family.
Please accept this token from the Dark Brotherhood. It is a virgin blade, and thirsts for blood. May it serve you well, as does your silence.

Dead Drop Orders #7
by Lucien Lachance

My compliments on another job well done! Havilstein Hoar-Blood was more swine than man, and deserved to die quivering like an animal! You must not stop! You must kill again!
Your next target is a Wood Elf named Ungolim, who resides in the city of Bravil. Bravil is also home to an ancient statue known as the Lucky Old Lady. It is seen as a symbol of good luck and prosperity, and the fools of Bravil often speak to the statue and wish for good tidings. Every night, poor lovestruck Ungolim visits the statue and pleads desperately for the heart of a young maiden. This maiden is married, and her husband has learned of Ungolim's affection for his bride. He fears the competition, it would seem, and has commissioned the Dark Brotherhood to help in the matter.
You must go to Bravil, locate Ungolim, and kill him. The Wood Elf owns a house in the city, but he spends his days securely locked inside. I recommend you lie in wait at the Lucky Old Lady statue, and then eliminate Ungolim when he arrives for his nightly visit. He's generally there between the hours of 6:00 PM and 1:00 AM.
By all accounts, Ungolim is a deadly archer and a fearless opponent. I also have reason to believe he is expecting trouble, so if Ungolim senses danger, he may attack you on sight. Be vigilant, and bring the Wood Elf down! You must not fail!
When Ungolim's body lies broken at the foot of his dear statue, you must journey to the city of Anvil. Your dead drop is in a barrel located behind the statue in the pond. As is standard, your reward and next contract will be waiting.

For the last few days, we've suffered attacks from these creatures at our farm not far from Chorrol. They're coming from someplace in the Great Forest. I don't know where, but Rallus may know more by now. My boys will take up the fight even if the guards won't. Doesn't matter if it's outside the town walls - it still affects us all. They expect me to go with them, but... I fear in my old age, I'm not the warrior I once was. Would you... would you go in my place?
I'm supposed to meet them at Weynon Priory. You'd best get whatever supplies you need now, so you can get there in time.
I... I need a drink to calm my nerves. Please, excuse me.

Luronk and I were shopping at Jensine's when he accused us of stealing. Even Jensine said we were innocent, but he didn't care. We had to pay his "fine" or go to jail.
He's shaken down most of the shopkeepers in the Market District. They're all too afraid of him to do anything. Jensine wouldn't even talk about it.

As you can see, we have dealt with the betrayer, Lucien Lachance! No longer will you serve as his puppet! It seems Lachance wanted revenge against the Dark Brotherhood for some reason, and used you to do his dirty work. But now, we can begin anew!
I bestow upon you the title of Speaker. You will take Lucien Lachance's place on the Black Hand! Welcome! As you know, the Black Hand is now in a state of disarray.

May the Night Mother hold you in her cold embrace.

Expect an unfriendly welcome at their hall. Finish it.

All that matters to me now is Malene. I'm no fool. I know she'd never be interested in an old man like me. It's enough just to be around her, to be in her company.
Well, if you're dead set on learning something from me, then how about you do a little something for me, first? Something for her, to be honest.
I'd like to get her a gift of a sort. Nothing terribly fancy, and something useful... How about a nice silver pitcher, and a set of four glasses. Here's 50 gold to cover the costs, that should be more than enough. Come see me when you've got everything, and we'll talk more.

I'll make it easy on you. I won't throw a single punch. I just want to see what you've got, anyway. So, is it a deal?
If I see you reach for a weapon, I'm calling it off. And if you can actually hurt me, I'll tell you to stop. If this goes on for too long, and I get bored, I'll stop you.
Now show me what you've got!

Thank goodness someone that can help is here! I don't know how to make this request any simpler, but to put it bluntly, Raelynn the Gravefinder must die.
A few months ago, that witch of a Necromancer decided to inhabit Moss Rock Cavern just north of my inn. I don't know what she does in there; frankly, I don't want to know. However, I do know that after she arrived, the woods at night became unsafe.
I've seen undead of all types walking in the dark woods near the cave entrance. Now, this area's getting a bad reputation and my business has waned. Every day, it seems the number of undead increase.
If someone can get into the cave and kill Raelynn, maybe we can stem the tide. Her death pays a handsome bounty. I hope you'll take advantage of the opportunity. Raelynn will finally get what's coming to her.

But this alchemist, he needs the scales right away. The alchemist was paying so much for the scales that I'm close to having enough saved so that I can retire. But now, I can't get out there to Lake Rumare -- not with this leg. I only needed twelve more scales! Can you believe it? I was so close!
I've picked up a few things in my travels. If you head out there and bring me back the twelve scales that I need, I can make it worth your time. Help an old fisherman out, won't you?

Crumpled Note
by G.S.

I guess you found the message I told you about, old friend. We've traveled together for so long, and you're the only one I trust with the ring and my story.
I knew climbing into the window of that wizard's house was a mistake, but the bounty on the ring was just too enticing to pass up. They said it was worth thousands of drakes... enough to keep me comfortable for a while as I lay low. They also said the owner of the ring was out of town at some meeting of wizards or some such.
They were wrong on both counts. You'd think I'd be used to this by now, dealing with the unpredictable in our line of work. But after trying to fence the ring all over the realm, no one would touch it. Worse still, the wizard was pursuing me the entire time. I had to call in many favors to stay one step ahead of him.
I decided to strike north and make for the neighboring land. As I was crossing the Jeralls, he finally caught up to me. Two fireballs later, I found myself tumbling down a steep snowy slope into a valley. Don't know where I am, but there are ruins of some old fort here. Luckily, that fetcher didn't follow me down; I assume he gave me up for dead.
I think I'm going to stash the ring in this valley, cross the border north, and return later when I feel it's safe. I've used some old chests I found in the ruins to make sure nobody stumbles across the ring by mistake; you know, the old key to a key thing like we used to do. If I don't make it back here, and you're reading this message, then the ring is all yours, my friend. Use it well and remember me.

I'm afraid I can't just write one out of hand. That would be against protocols, you see. If perhaps you can clear up a small matter involving Earana, you can prove your loyalty to the guild and earn my recommendation.
Earana and I have an unpleasant history. She does not care for Guild regulations, and errantly believes I am mis-using my powers. I have seen that she is in town. Though she has not approached me, I know she wants something.
I would like you to find out what it is. Determine what Earana's after, and how we may be rid of her. I do not want her here, spreading her lies.

Dead Drop Orders #4
by Lucien Lachance

J'Ghasta is dead! Well done! I was right about you, Silencer. You are a useful tool indeed. Let's see if you can continue to impress me.
You must journey now to the Flooded Mine. There you will find Shaleez, an Argonian hunter who was banished from her village near the Black Marsh/Morrowind border for the brutal murder of a Dark Elven family. Relatives of the murdered family members have located Shaleez, and demand retribution. And, since the assignment is a bit far for Morrowind's Morag Tong to handle, the Dark Brotherhood has been commissioned to perform the elimination.
Be warned, Silencer! Shaleez is a skilled and deadly hunter, and will fight like the desperate fugitive she is.
After Shaleez has been eliminated, your reward and another contract will be waiting at the dead drop located in a coffin, just outside the ruins of Fort Redman.

 I am Vilena Donton. I am the player's guildmaster in the Fighters Guild. bear pelts is an object. 
You would steal from your brothers? If you had a need for something, why would you not just ask?
I will give you a chance, though. As it is only your first offense, do not return until you have collected 20 bear pelts.
Use this time to reflect on your actions.

 I am Ocheeva. I am the player's superior in the Dark Brotherhood. Fort Sutch is a location. Fort Sutch is  a fort far to the west, nestled in the mountains. Roderick is present in Fort Sutch. Roderick is a male warlord. 
Far to the west there lives a fierce warlord and his company of loyal mercenaries. Your target is the warlord. Do you accept this contract?
Now listen closely. Nestled in the mountains to the west lies Fort Sutch. It is the home of the warlord Roderick and his mercenaries. Roderick has recently taken ill. He now lies in eternal slumber, kept alive only by the daily administration of a powerful medicine.
You must infiltrate Fort Sutch, find Roderick's medicine, and replace it with a poisoned bottle I will provide. But you must remain undetected! Whomever arranged this contract wants it to look like Roderick died from his illness, so discretion is essential. Attack no one! Be seen by no one! If you are detected, the poisoning will fail, and Roderick must be killed in some other manner. That will, of course, forfeit your bonus.
Roderick may lie near death, but dead he is not. Until his soul has passed, our client -- and the Grim Reaper himself -- will not be satisfied.

Some of your brothers have been getting rowdy at the local tavern. I've got no problem with cutting loose, but I don't like it when we all look bad. You're looking for Rellian, Vantus Prelius, and Dubok gro-Shagk. I haven't had any trouble with them before, so find out what's going on.

We need a Great Sigil Stone. You're not going to like it. Jauffre doesn't like it. The Countess of Bruma certainly isn't going to like it. Great Sigil Stones are the anchors of Great Gates. The kind of gate the Mythic Dawn opened at Kvatch. The kind of Gate the Mythic Dawn wants to open here to destroy Bruma.
The risk is great, I know. I was at Kvatch. I saw the terrible power of the Daedric siege engine. But we have no choice. The only way to recover the Amulet of Kings is to allow the Mythic Dawn to proceed with their plan to attack Bruma.
Please, my friend. I explain myself to you so you understand me. And so you can explain to the Countess. I'm afraid she may take a bit more convincing than you.
Have the Countess of Bruma meet me in the Chapel of Talos for a council of war. That seems a fitting place to make such desperate plans.

Dead Drop Orders #1
by Lucien Lachance

Silencer,
You are now reading your first dead drop note, here on Hero Hill, which proves to me you were well-appointed to the tasks that lie ahead.
Journey now to Leafrot Cave. There you will encounter an ancient necromancer who is attempting to escape death by transforming himself into a lich. This necromancer, Celedaen, has not yet completed his metamorphosis, but is still immensely powerful, possibly too powerful to destroy if confronted directly. Search Leafrot Cave. Necromancers are wizards after all, and wizards are prolific by nature. Celedaen surely has written records, and these records may contain evidence of some kind of weakness. Perhaps there is some other way to destroy Celedaen besides a direct confrontation. But destroy him you must!
When the necromancer lies dead, journey to the city of Chorrol for your next dead drop. At the foot of the Great Oak, hidden in the bushes, is an old sack. Inside you will find your reward for killing the necromancer, as well as information regarding your next contract.
Serve me well, Silencer, and there's no telling just how far you might advance.

You seem far too nice to be one of Ulrich Leland's men. What can I do for you?
Don't even get me started about Ulrich. That madman won't be satisfied until everyone in town is dead broke...or in jail! What in Oblivion is Ulrich doing with all that money anyway? I'm sure he's lining his pockets with the gold of the good citizens of Cheydinhal.
There's only one man who seems to care: Garrus Darelliun, the second-in-command of the guard. I hear he isn't happy with Ulrich. I don't know what you can do for us in this situation. I mean, Ulrich Leland is the Captain after all.
Perhaps you could speak to Garrus. You can find him roaming the County Hall of the castle most of the time.

Hear me, and hear me well. Mannimarco will have what he seeks, but it will be his undoing at your hands.
With this gem in your possession, you will be impervious to his attempt to enthrall you. When he fails, that is when you shall strike. When we are done speaking, you will take this gem, you will then seek out Mannimarco, and destroy him. Get to him anyway you can. It is your only hope for defeating him. I have full confidence in you, and so I leave the guild in your care.
When I am gone, you will be recognized as Arch-Mage and leader of the Guild. Lead your fellow mages, and lead them well. The future rests on your shoulders.

Thank you for coming.
You may recognize that statue over there on the table. The very one that you recently sold -- for less than its true worth.
As you may know, I am somewhat of an enthusiast for Ayleid antiquities. In my own modest way, I have amassed a rather considerable collection.
I have recently become interested in obtaining the complete set of these ancient statues. I believe that ten still exist within the various ancient Ayleid Ruins. No mere shopkeeper knows their true worth.
If you bring them to me when you find them, I will pay you double for each one.

A recommendation, from me? Well, of course. Raminus would naturally want my opinion, wouldn't he?
This is a situation we can both benefit from, Associate. You do me a small favor, and I'll happily send along a glowing recommendation.
J'skar's disappeared. I mean he's really disappeared. No one here has seen him in days. Volanaro thinks maybe a spell backfired. If someone from the Council were to stop by, and find him gone, it'd look bad for me. I can't have that. Talk to the mages here, and see what you can find out.
If you can make J'skar re-appear, you'll have your recommendation.

I've just received word from the Countess of Bruma that an Oblivion Gate has opened outside the city. It seems that the Mythic Dawn are putting their plan to attack Bruma into motion.
Since you've dealt with these Gates before, I'd like you to help the Countess's guard close this gate. Once they've seen how it's done, they should be able to handle any new gates on their own.
Captain Burd is waiting for you outside the Bruma city gate. He'll show you the Oblivion Gate. Although I doubt it will be hard to find.

Dead Drop Orders #3
by Lucien Lachance

Are you ready to get your hands dirty, Silencer?
Your next target is a Khajiit nobleman by the name of J'Ghasta, who can be found at his home in the city of Bruma. J'Ghasta was recently offered the hand of a prominent Cyrodiil noble's daughter, but turned down the offer when he learned of the girl's rather negligible dowry. The girl's family is outraged, of course, and has hired the Dark Brotherhood to make J'Ghasta pay for his insolence.
Go to J'Ghasta's house in Bruma and end his miserable life. But be warned! The Khajiit is rich and bored, and spends most of his time honing his skills in unarmed combat. Any opponent who can kill with merely his hands is not to be trifled with, so tread carefully. Even worse, J'Ghasta is aware someone may be trying to kill him, and has bribed the guards not to interfere if a fight should spill out into the city streets.
When the target has been eliminated, you will find your next dead drop in a rotten box under the Old Bridge, just south of the Imperial City. The box will contain your reward for killing J'Ghasta, as well as information regarding your next contract.

You want to help? You're kidding, right? Hmm... if you're serious, maybe I can put you to use. It'll likely mean your death, though.
I don't know how to close this Gate, but it must be possible, because the enemy closed the ones they opened during the initial attack. You can see the marks on the ground where they were, with the Great Gate right in the middle. I sent men into the Gate, to see if they could find a way to shut it. They haven't come back. If you can get in there, find out what happened to them. If they're alive, help them finish the job. If not, see what you can do on your own.
The best I can say is, good luck. If you make it back alive, we'll be waiting for you. It's a brave thing you're doing.

Find out where Springheel Jak is buried and bring me back those boots. Will you do this for me? It pays well.
The Earl of Imbel is the only descendant of Springheel Jak's line that I have been able to locate. His name is Jakben, and he lives somewhere in the Imperial City. There might be a clue in the Earl's house.

 I am Kud-Ei. I am the player's superior in the Mages Guild. 
I'm afraid I haven't had time to prepare anything conventional for your recommendation. I'm very preoccupied with this situation concerning Ardaline.
Perhaps you can help with that, however. I can't directly get involved, for fear of embarrassing the poor girl. Varon Vamori's been bothering Ardaline every day for a while now. He even stole her Mages' Staff! Perhaps he thinks it's amusing; I don't know. But it needs to stop. It's making her miserable.
I'll need you to have a little chat with Varon Vamori to get Ardaline's staff back, and you can learn something about the power of Illusion in the process. Take this charm scroll. With it, you should find Varon more receptive to questioning.
Don't come back without that staff. I'll write you a recommendation for your help.

 I am Erline. I am a shocked wife. Bruma is a location. Erline is present in Bruma. Bruma is a location. Bruma is a city. Carius is present in Bruma. Carius is a male criminal investigator. 
I can't believe this is happening. Please... please. I need your help. My husband was no vampire! It's ridiculous! No one will listen to me! Forgive me. I loved my husband dearly, and to lose him this way makes no sense. Anything you can do to help would be wonderful. This is all happening so fast.
I came home only just a few hours ago. I found the door open, and my Bradon dead. Standing over him was a Dunmer. I screamed and ran out into the street. Some city watch were nearby and heard me I suppose, as they arrived quickly. I heard the Dunmer identify himself as Raynil Dralas. He said he was a vampire hunter and that Bradon was his mark. The guards seemed to know about Raynil, and after a search of the house, the body of some beggar was found stashed in our basement. The guards sent for Carius, who is an investigator for crimes here in Bruma. In minutes, Raynil convinced Carius that Bradon was a vampire.
Why would he stash a body in his own house? That's ridiculous! And another thing. The guards are making a big deal out of no one seeing Bradon out in the daylight. Well of course that's the case! He works at night, and has to sleep during the day. Why does that make him a vampire? It's all that Raynil character. I don't trust him. The thing that bothers me the most is that I swear I've seen him before. Of course he says he's never been here. Look, there isn't much more to say. Please... help me clear my husband's name.
Just find Raynil Dralas, and make him tell you the truth. I swear, he's a liar!

How many people have you killed in your lifetime, eh? Not as many as I, my little friend. When we're equals, you might interest me and get some blunt weapons training out of it.
If you've killed fifty people, it's still not enough for my tastes, but I might reconsider training you at that point.
Leave some bloody trails and tell yourself they all deserved it. Right? Ha, ha.

They hope to learn enough from it to find some sort of way to fight Mannimarco. I tried to dissuade them, but it was no use.
I would like the helm to be returned, so that it may be kept safe here in the Arcane University. I fear Irlav has made himself a target for the Necromancers.

 I am Martin. I am the player's friend. 
I've figured out another item needed for the ritual to open the portal to Camoran's Paradise. The second item is the counterpart to the first: the blood of a Divine.
This was a terrible puzzle to me. Unlike the Daedra, the gods have no artifacts, and do not physically manifest themselves in our world.
How then to obtain the blood of a god? But Jauffre solved it. The blood of Tiber Septim himself, who became one of the Divines. This is a secret remembered only by the Blades, passed down from one Grandmaster to the next.
Jauffre should tell it to you himself.

 I am Vicente Valtieri. I am the player's superior in the Dark Brotherhood. Bruma is a location. Bruma is a city. Baenlin's house is a location. Baenlin is present in Baenlin's house. Baenlin is a male Wood Elf. Gromm is present in Baenlin's house. Gromm is Baenlin's manservant. 
We need you to stage an... accident. Kill the target in the manner specified, and you'll receive a considerable bonus. The target is a Wood Elf named Baenlin. You will find him at his home in Bruma.
Enter secretly and avoid his manservant, Gromm. On the second floor is a secreted door leading to a crawlspace. Inside are the fastenings of a mounted head that hangs over Baenlin's favorite chair. Loosen the fastenings any night between 8:00 pm and 11:00 pm, and the head will surely fall on Baenlin as he relaxes in his chair, as is custom. If Baenlin is killed in any other manner, or if the manservant Gromm is killed, you will forfeit the bonus.
Now go, and may Death be with you.

Mysterium Xarxes is an object. Mysterium Xarxes is a book of rituals. Daedric is an object. Daedric is an adjective referring to the Daedra. 
I've deciphered part of the ritual needed to open a portal to Camoran's Paradise.
The Mysterium Xarxes mentions four items needed for the ritual, but so far I have only deciphered one of them: the 'blood of a Daedra Lord'. In fact, Daedric artifacts are known to be formed from the essence of a Daedric Lord, from whence they derive their great power. Not an easy thing to come by, obviously, but we will need a Daedric artifact.
The only way to obtain a Daedric artifact is through the cults devoted to each of the Daedric Lords. The book "Modern Heretics" is the best introduction to Daedric cults. The library here has a copy if you need it.
Bring the artifact to me when you have acquired one. Remember, the Mysterium Xarxes ritual will consume the physical form of the artifact in order to release its Daedric power.

Thinking you know how to use a shield is one thing. Actually using one is quite another. So here's what we're going to do. We're going to find out whether or not you can hold up in combat. You put up your shield, and I hit you. If you're still standing when I'm done, you've earned the right to learn what I have to teach.

Until I hear your name spoken by others, don't expect any training from me. When you're known as a hero or a villain, I might change my mind.

I've had attacks on my small flock of sheep lately. I was hoping that building a fence would solve the problem, but it hasn't helped at all. Then, one day when I was just about to step outside, I saw the culprits. A group of West Weald Bears was dragging away a sheep carcass. There's no way I can fight those ferocious beasts off on my own.
If you could thin the population a bit, they would probably leave the area. Kill six of the things, bring me their fangs as proof, and I'll reward you well.
Please, you're my only hope.

Maybe once you've done that, we can talk about how to better pace yourself. I'll teach you what I know about athletics. Maybe we can swap stories about life on the road, too.

So here it is: What does the name Hazadir mean to you? Few recognize the name anymore, even though he was famous.
Had a book written about him, in fact! I don't have a copy myself, but there was one in First Edition last time I was browsing there. At least some people take an interest in history.

Good. You're here. We've got duties to attend to.
I've been looking into the Blackwood Company. Heard some disturbing things. We know they're a danger to us. And we know they're good at what they do.
I've heard stories, but nothing I can prove is true. Maybe they've got a mage working with them. Maybe they're just well trained. All I know for sure is that they'll accept any contract, and they'll do anything to complete it. And they don't care who gets in the way.
We were contracted by a wizard, Argoth, to recover an artifact from Azani Blackheart, a ruthless bandit leader. I went in there with twenty men. I left with five. Vitellus Donton wasn't one of them. He died covering our retreat. I snooped around. Apparently, the Blackwood Company completed that contract for us. I went in there with twenty good men. I can't believe that bunch finished the job. There's more. Argoth -- he's dead, the artifact gone. Sounds like a set-up. Maybe they made a deal with Blackheart. I don't know. But I'll find out.
Now we find out what really happened. And we let it be known. I want to show the people who the Blackwood Company really are. I can't order you do this with me. It's dangerous, and Vilena Donton isn't going to know about it. It's your choice.
If you accept this mission, we leave as soon as you're ready. I want to investigate Blackheart's stronghold at Arpenia. Meet me at the Leyawiin guild hall. We'll go from there.

Word has been sent that the Necromancers have been quite busy, creating black soul gems for their master. In particular, a unique Black Soul Gem has been crafted in the south of Cyrodiil, in the ruins of Silorn.
This gem needs to be confiscated and brought here, before it can be delivered to the King of Worms and used against us. I have need of it. I believe the Black Soul Gem  may be instrumental in saving our guild. I will explain once you have returned with it. Until then, discussion is useless.
A contingent of Battlemages has been sent to the site. I would like you to oversee their actions on my behalf. The only thing that matters is that gem. Do you understand? Once you have it safely in your possession, return here immediately.
Know that you have my complete confidence. I would not entrust this job to you if I did not feel you were prepared for it. Now, go.

You are to travel north to the Brina Cross Inn, and speak with Arielle Jurard. She will give you further instructions.
This is a harsh, dangerous task for you, I realize. Your unfamiliar face makes you most useful, however. And, what better way to learn the many uses of Restoration? Practical application is often the best educator. Even in life and death situations.

In keeping with tradition, you must use a specific tool in the Ancestor Glade, an implement known as a Draw Knife. Every Moth Priest is taught this ritual, but few ever get the chance to perform it... you should consider yourself fortunate if it works for you.
Once enough of the moths are following, they'll provide you with the second sight needed to decipher the Elder Scrolls. From what I saw in the vision, the Elder Scroll which foreshadows the defiance of the gods with the blood of mortals is the key to the prophecy.

The College of Winterhold was the first place I'd think to go for any kind of magic or historical thing. The wizards there know about all kinds of things that people probably shouldn't know about.

I will place my name with you and grant you the right to call my name from Tamriel. Do me this simple honor and I will fight at your side as your Grah-Zeymahzin, your Ally, and teach you my Thu'um.

Idiots! Brodir and Herd were at each others' throats again today, and nearly came to blows. The whole camp is on edge. I've ordered an extra ration of mead, but unless this fighting stops, we'll tear ourselves apart.

11th of First Seed, 4E 201
Rumor is that Herd's gathering followers for a mutiny. Brodir's not stupid; he's probably doing the same, just for insurance. I'd kill them both myself, but the camp's split right down the middle. If I tried, there'd be a knife in my back within a week.
I can't take this anymore. I've begun skimming a little gold from the take, bringing it down here when I can. If I can scrape enough together, I'll make a run for it, head downriver to Dragon Bridge.

28th of First Seed, 4E 201
Brodir's getting suspicious -- I caught him poking around in the cove this afternoon. I don't think he found my stash, but it's not safe here. I took the boat out tonight and stowed it on the island to the south, by the old tree stump.
Had a good haul this week. Another caravan or two and I can finally get out of here, and not a moment too soon.

I found the ring's resting place, Shrouded Grove, after he died, but I'm far too old to go exploring some cave, now. I'd be happy to give you some alchemy training in exchange for the ring, if you bring it to me.

He mostly keeps to himself, and so far he's been able to pay. I just hate to see what's happened to him. He hasn't always been like this, you know. Drunk, I mean.
He was a different person. Happy, outgoing... Like anyone who's in love. See, Ranmir was involved with a pretty young woman named Isabelle Rolaine. The two of them were very happy together, I thought. One day, she just disappeared. Ranmir was convinced she'd run off with someone else, leaving him behind. He turned to drinking, and what's left of him is what you see here every day.
I hoped that maybe if she could be found, if he had some sort of explanation, that maybe he could put himself back together. I'm in no position to go searching for her, but perhaps you could. Ranmir seemed convinced that Isabelle'd run off to Riften with someone named Vex. That's all I remember.

It's powerful and tremendously addicting... I've seen men fail to finish even a single flask.
If I knew where they were stashing the bottles, I'd put an end to it myself. Could you track down the stash? That would be helpful. I just don't have time to do it myself right now.
They're too smart to have left it in the Bulwark. I'd search one of the abandoned houses on the outskirts of town.

But first you'll need to learn who he is. Assuming, of course, that the Gourmet actually is a "he." Could be a woman for all we know. In my, um, investigations, I came upon this. It's a copy of the Gourmet's cookbook. Ah, but not just any copy. It's signed you see! Seems to be a message from the Gourmet to one Anton Virane. I've tracked Virane to the keep in Markarth. It would seem he's the cook.
You are to obtain that information from Virane - who the Gourmet really is, and where he can be found. Oh, and when you're done with Virane, kill him. Loose ends and all that.
As I was saying... You'll need to kill the Gourmet, of course. But what's more, you'll need to get his Writ of Passage, so you can take his place. Oh, and if you can, hide his body. The longer it takes for anyone else to determine his real identity, the better.
Now off with you!

If you can bring me these materials, the Phial can again be made whole. You can keep the White Phial after I have repaired it. I fear keeping the Phial would just remind me of Nurelion's obsession, and how it consumed him.

Cicero's taken to locking himself in the Night Mother's chamber, and talking. To someone. In hushed, but frantic tones. Who is he speaking with? What are they planning? I fear treachery. As the Night Mother's Keeper, he believes he's entitled to the rule of this Sanctuary. Cicero will cite our independence as the need to revert to the Old Ways. He'll claim we're undisciplined, unruly. Heretical, even. Ironically, the Night Mother could prove to be just as much a victim. The queen in a fool's twisted game of chess.
I need you to steal into that chamber, and eavesdrop on their meeting. It'll be no use clinging to the shadows. They'll see you for sure. No, you need a hiding place. Somewhere they'd never think to look. Like inside the Night Mother's coffin.

Buried in the ash, like most other things on this blasted island. Dug out a pile of the stuff taller than me just to find the barrow. Who knows how much to reach the door.

When you have 1,000 gold for me, I'll head back to Raven Rock and round up some diggers. Once we've got something worth looking at, I'll send word to you.

I expect he'd appreciate some help in locating any additional magical artifacts here in the ruins. Any enchanted items will do; the usefulness of the enchantment is irrelevant. If you find anything, the class can look it over.

He used to have a home in Dawnstar until they burned it down. The people say he was doing unspeakable experiments on reanimation... rituals only a necromancer would perform. After he made for Yngvild, he was never heard from again.
In his later years, Arondil moved into some ice caves known as Yngvild. He preferred the solitude in which to perform his, um... experiments.

Want to come along and help me find this totem of Hircine?

Books. Don't know why the Imperials like them so much. It should help the boy, though, Malacath willing. Bring the book, and I'll show you how an Orc learns to smith.

My mother, Bera, was Skaal, but she left the village and I was born in Skyrim. A trade ship from Skyrim struck ice off the coast near the village, and the Skaal took in the surviving sailors. My mother fell in love with one of the sailors - my father - and eventually returned with him to Skyrim.
I came across a few of my mother's old things not long ago. Among them was a necklace that my father gave to her when they were married. I believe she would want it placed upon her tombstone in Falkreath, as a symbol of her undying love and the great sacrifice she made for it.
If you find yourself in Falkreath, please give this amulet to the priest Runil and tell him that I sent you. He will understand. I don't have much to give in reward, but return to me when the task is done and I'll do what I can. Thank you, Skaal-friend.

Several months ago I ordered a special silver mold from some artisans in Valenwood. Well, it never arrived. Later I found out that it was robbed by a group of bandits led by someone named Rigel Strong-Arm.
Look, I talked to everyone with an ounce of authority... everyone. They all told me their resources were spread too thin right now. Word on the street says that the Thieves Guild is coming back into its own in Markarth so I figured... ...to send a thief to steal back what was stolen.
Look, this mold is irreplaceable. I'll pay you well for its return and I can also prove to be quite a valuable ally to the Thieves Guild.  The only thing I can tell you is that the mold was taken to the bandit's hideout... a small cottage called Pinewatch.
I'm not sure how many men they have inside, but I trust that won't be an issue for you. Good luck.

Heddic's Volunruud Notes
by Heddic Volunnar

I was skeptical, but it's obvious now. The old hymns had truth to them! The relief wasn't far from the entrance, just as they said. I've no doubt now that it hides the entrance to Kvenel's tomb.
The two keys must be hidden somewhere nearby - ceremonial replicas of Okin and Eduj, favored weapons when Kvenel went into battle. I don't dare explore further without hiring bodyguards to accompany me, however. To think - The Tongue Chieftain Kvenel could be entombed behind just a few feet of stone! The ancestor we scarcely believed was real.
Twice damned for planning this foolish scouting trip. I should have hired those sellswords in the first place. Perhaps there's no need. This place is just a tomb, after all, and there are no obvious signs of habitation. It isn't as though the thousand-year dead will mind if I have a look around.

But their cruelty was too great for men to bear, and they rose up in what would be called the Dragon War and the Cult swept from the land.

As I said, I want you to kill several people. You'll find the targets, as well as their manners of elimination, quite varied. I'm sure someone of your disposition will probably even find it enjoyable. But you should know that these killings are but a means to an end. For they pave the way to the most important target. The real reason I'm speaking with a cutthroat in the bowels of this detestable crypt. For I seek the assassination of... ...the Emperor.
What I ask is no small thing, of course. But you represent the Dark Brotherhood. This is... what you do? No? You must understand. So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. Now, it's as if the very stars have finally aligned. But I digress. Here, take these two items. They need to be delivered to your, um... superior. The sealed letter will explain everything that needs to be done. The amulet is quite valuable - you can use it to pay for any and all expenses.

 I am Vex. I am the player's superior in the Thieves Guild. 
When a client needs us to eliminate another, we don't operate like the Dark Brotherhood. We find alternate means to get them out of the way.

Since then, his writings have been scattered all over Skyrim, but are little use to anyone who can't translate them. I'm one of the few who can. I'm always trying to find more of Shalidor's writings.
I've heard whispers of more of his work having turned up. If you can track it down, it may prove useful to all of us.

Thanks for getting me out of that. Bashnag's coven chased me out and left me for dead down here. Nobody lasts too long with the spiders.
Please, will you help me get out of here? If the coast is clear, I'll make a break for it. We - well 'they', Bashnag's circle of mages, live here. They made it pretty clear that I'm no longer welcome. These are no dainty college mages. Bashnag has the skill of a magister and the mind of a warlord.
This is a dangerous bunch. They're good company if you want to study necromancy in peace, though.

If only you could negotiate a truce between Ulfric and General Tullius. Then I would be glad to help you with your mad dragon-trapping scheme. But getting both sides to agree to a truce will be difficult at this point. The bitterness has gone too deep. Maybe... hmm... what of the Greybeards? They are respected by everyone. High Hrothgar is neutral territory. If the Greybeards were willing to host a peace council... then maybe Ulfric and Tullius would have to listen.

I have met gods and long-dead races of people and everything in between and I know enough to see a vampire where others would see a man.

It is possible to cure vampirism. I know of a ritual but I've never performed it. It requires a filled black soul gem. You will need to kill someone. When you have a gem and have filled it return to me and I will perform the ritual. I will bring life to your dead body, vampire.

They found it! They actually found Rjorn's drum!
You don't know who Rjorn is? You're joking, right? Rjorn? Only the most famous battle drummer of the second age. Well, famous among bards at least. That drum has been in half a dozen famous battles. It's a priceless artifact.
Nobody knows where he died, and therefore where his drum might be. Halldir was the missing link. Rjorn was always looking for new stories to tell. It seems he was writing a lay about Halldir when he vanished. Rjorn entered Halldir's Cairn in secret, and presumably died there.
Now all I need to do is find someone to get it. Wait. You. You could do it. I need you to get me that drum. The college treasury is a bit thin right now. But I can show you some tricks I learned from my days with the army.

Sad, isn't it? We can't afford to keep the place running since these attacks started. Pirates, you see. Raiding all along the coast, from Hammerfell to Vvardenfell.
Our own security forces are limited, and all the mercenaries are tied up in this ridiculous war. We don't even know their base of operations, and attacking single ships won't really solve the problem.
Only the Shatter-Shields appear safe. They are a very powerful family here in Windhelm. They run a private shipping operation, and would love to have the docks to themselves. Wouldn't surprise me if they were in league with the pirates, somehow.
Not yet, no. But perhaps an intrepid person such as yourself could help with that. They have a dark elf who oversees their operations. Suvaris Atheron. She's meticulous to a fault, and keeps a logbook with every transaction she makes.
If you get me the logbook, I'll have proof of Shatter-Shield's treachery.

It looks like you're ready to speak with the Augur. He was a brilliant mage. Truly inspired. Mastered spells others could barely comprehend. He was especially gifted when it came to Restoration.
The Augur's... Well, he's very particular about who shares the knowledge. So you'll need his approval first. Go on, go talk to him. I'm sure he's been paying attention, and will be expecting you.

Rieklings overcame us with tenacity and numbers. Didn't help that we'd grown a little too comfortable up there. Too much mead. Too many stories. Too few battles.
Are you... offering to help? Some new blood should be enough to rouse these layabouts to actually fight again.

By the gods! I know this looks bad. Let me explain...
I called Darklight Tower home, now I know that was a mistake. I am, or was part of a coven serving the Hagravens that live there. So was she.
We were supposed to find a sacrifice. Human sacrifice. I told her I couldn't do it and she attacked me. I've done horrible things living here, but never taken an innocent life. I couldn't just find some person for them to kill. We needed a sacrifice for the Initiation. My mother is going to become one of those things, Hagravens. I can't be a part of that.

I'm going up there to stop her. This cycle must end. I don't know what brought you here, but I could use your help, if you're willing. Follow me. We have to fight our way up the Tower. I don't think anyone else here is about to have a change of heart.

Anything you steal, you bring it straight to me. Now get out of here and don't come back until your pockets are full. Only then you're one of us again.

They could be anywhere on the island. The mines might be a good place to start. If you find any while you're exploring Solstheim, bring them here and I'll pay you for them.

Eisa's Journal
by Eisa Blackthorn

Night shift woke me to say they'd hit something big. Kyr, Ra'jirr, and I went down to take a look. It's huge, like a whole forest was just swallowed up by the earth, with a big old monument out in the center. Kyr took a sword from the monument as a trophy and dubbed it the "Pale Blade", proof his whole plan was finally paying off. For once, he might be right.

Ra'jirr's been having nightmares over the past few days. He keeps muttering about a "Pale Lady" - one of those swamp women who steal children away at night, I think. To think some fool story could turn the toughest bandit I know into a cowering kitten, frightened of his own shadow. I'm just glad none of the others see him like this.

It's getting worse. Ra'jirr can barely sleep at all now, and whenever he dozes off, he wakes up screaming - woke the whole place last night. He says the "Pale Lady" is coming for us - she's down in the forest, we have to return the sword or she'll kill us all. Not a chance - the boss clings to that thing like he was born with it. I've told everyone Ra'jirr just has a fever, but this can't go on. I've pulled a few things together. I'll slip out tonight and never look back.

A fellow Breton who went by the name Esmond Tyne showed up on my doorstep about a fortnight ago. He stole something from me: my own formula for improved bonemold. Took me years to perfect.
Before he ran off, he was talking some nonsense about trying to fence goods to the Rieklings at Castle Karstaag. I told him he was crazy to even think about talking to those vicious little buggers, but he wouldn't listen. I'd bet a fat purse of coin that he's either dead or hiding out up there.

But perhaps the two of us together will be able to get the book. To Nchardak, then. Follow me.

Justice demands that he, Paarthurnax, dies for his crimes. Until he is dead, I'm afraid my oath as a Blade prevents me from offering you aid and comfort.

With the war, many more ships come through these docks. Loaded with weapons and pay, but few people. And they pass through dangerous waters. We have an interest in one of those boats, the Icerunner. The Solitude Lighthouse will be guiding it in... but if its fire were to go out, the Icerunner would run aground.
If someone were to put out the lighthouse fire and then meet me on the docks afterwards... I could certainly direct them to that loot. That someone could be you.

If you think there's anything you can do, be my guest. About a year or two ago, some fella named Wyndelius came through; said he was some kind of a treasure hunter. I warned him not to go in there, just like I warned you. The very next night we heard screams from the barrow, and that was it. We never saw him again.

I left that one in Windhelm at the White Phial alchemy shop. It was a good trade too. Ah well.
Bring those items back to me and I'll be happy to experiment on you. No, no... that isn't right. I'd be happy to reward you.

It was only through blind luck that I was able to crawl away from the Dwemer abomination and make my way to the surface.

Habd's Journal
by Habd

After years of sailing from Hammerfell to Solstheim and back, Ramati and I have finally saved enough money to buy that old light house we spotted on the coast and we are moving in next month.
These northerners really know how to live. It may be cold, but you can't beat the tranquility of the watching icebergs to live out your silver years. Ramati loves the place too, despite the occasional leaky ceiling. Mani and Sudi, unfortunately, seem miserable here; I know the kids are old enough to strike out on their own, but I hope they'll grow to love the peace and quiet here as I have.
Mani and Sudi continue to bicker and harass each other and they seem to have started in on their mother as well. Ramati keeps finding things missing from the cellar. Sudi said she heard a noise down there but Mani just thinks their mother is going mad from isolation. The very thought of it is ridiculous, she's always wanted to retire here!
Sudi keeps saying that she hears scratching coming from the cellar at night. I think she's just trying to get her mother's goat, but I'd better head into town to get a few traps just in case it's rats. Should only take a couple days. I just hope those two go easy on Ramati while I'm gone.
Oh gods. Oh gods why? I returned home to find my beautiful Ramati killed and this thing, this horrible bug-like creature ransacking our home. I managed to kill the damned thing, I think it might be a demon! I've never seen anything like it! Oh gods poor Ramati. It must have come out of the cellar. I'm going down there and locking the door behind me to make sure they don't escape. I don't know if I'll make it out, but I have to save my family!

Midden Incident Report
by Anonymous

The missing students were found in the Midden this morning. Dead, as expected. None of us bothered keeping a detect life charm for the search at this point.
The bodies were found together, each suffering the same deformities; peeled and bubbling skin on the arms and face. Conjurer's burn, as it's commonly referred to around the College. There's little doubt they were attempting a summoning ritual well beyond their capabilities.
The relic nearby put any doubt in this theory to rest. I admit that I've never seen one like it - a large, segmented sculpture of a gauntlet, the Daedric sigil 'O' emblazoned upon the palm. Attempts to move it were in vain. I must show it to the Archmage during his upcoming visit. Perhaps he will know more.
While we couldn't move the relic, I was able to pry four "rings" from it. I'm sure there's a connection between them and the ritual the students were attempting.
I'll store these in the Arcanaeum until we can consult with a conjuration master to learn more.

If you see him, tell him Grosta said he can go straight to hell... he's not welcome here any more.

Daynas Valen's Notes
by Daynas Valen

How to summarize a lifetime of research? So little of what I have learned matters now - the petty politics of ancient times, the age-long campaign to wipe out all mention of the Gauldur name.
In the opening days of the First Era, the Archmage Gauldur was revered throughout the north. Wisdom, wealth, honor, and power were his, and even the legendary heros' heirs sought his counsel.
Smothered by his shadow, Gauldur's three sons grew cruel and resentful. They lusted after their father's power and prestige, and eventually Jyrik, the eldest, discovered its source: a mysterious amulet, from which he never parted. Together, they conspired to murder their father in his sleep and divide his amulet between them. And so it was done.
Consumed by their newfound power, the brothers laid waste to the surrounding villages. So great was the carnage that the High King himself intervened, sending a company of battlemages led by the Archmage Geirmund to subdue the brothers. And after a devastating battle, the three fled the field.
Mikrul, the youngest, was run to ground in Folgunthur, the ancient barrows at the foot of Solitude. Geirmund pursued Jyrik to the shattered crypts of Saarthal, half-buried even then. And at last, Sigdis was cornered in the southernmost reaches of land and later entombed in Geirmund's Hall.

Torkild had a wild gleam in his eye, more than most. In my darkest times, I fear he fell in among the werebears of the glacier.
Werebears are twisted, cursed beasts. True bears are noble and great creatures of the wild. I've heard tell of men who, by curse or by heart's desire, become transformed into one of those vile things. It is a pitiable fate. And one that I fear has fallen to my brother.
If you happen to cross his path, be wary. He was a fierce warrior as a man. If he fell prey to his more bestial side, he could be deadly.

Mark my words, these mines hold a secret that could put Raven Rock back on the map. A secret the East Empire Company swept under the rug two centuries ago. It killed my great-grandfather, Gratian Caerellius, and left Raven Rock with a worthless and tainted mine.
East Empire Company called it "a terrible accident", claiming that he was lost in a rockfall, but I know better. My wife and I were cleaning out our home, and we came across some of my great-grandfather's things locked in an old chest. I found an unsent letter he'd written to the East Empire Company, and a key.
The letter describes a discovery that was made in the mine by some of the diggers. They wanted Gratian to take a closer look. The East Empire Company must have felt it was of great value, as they locked that section of the mine off from everyone else. I assume the key unlocks that section of the mine. I haven't been able to find the entrance.
I'm telling you... there's something big down there, something that the East Empire Company wanted to hide from everyone.

To restore Master Elgrim's supply I would need 20 deathbell, 20 nightshade and 20 nirnroot. Am I sensing that you may be interested in gathering these rare ingredients for me? That means more time for my experiments and less time in the field. Much appreciated.

It's kind of an understanding between us. I mean, it just wouldn't feel right to charge them for a bit of preserved food. Trouble is, my legs aren't what they used to be and climbing the 7,000 Steps takes its toll.
You'd like to make the delivery for me? Really? That would be kind of you. Here, take this bag of supplies. At the top of the steps you'll see the offering chest. Just leave the bag inside and you're done.

The Ancestral Tombs are where we inter our dead. They are sacred places, meant to honor their passing. Sadly, we've been unable to use the Ancestral Tomb beneath the Temple as of late, and have resorted to other locations to scatter the remains.
Those foul vermin... the abominations we call ash spawn have risen from the ashes of our own ancestors. They're befouling the memories of our forefathers by defiling their remains.
Could you cleanse the tomb for us, wanderer? That would be most kind. Here, this key should open the door to the tomb.

 I am Brynjolf. I am a thief. 
I've got a bit of an errand to perform, but I need an extra pair of hands. And in my line of work, extra hands are well-paid.
It's simple... I'm going to cause a distraction and you're going to steal Madesi's silver ring from a strongbox under his stand. Once you have it, I want you to place it in Brand-Shei's pocket without him noticing.

I hate Haelga! It's everything about her. She's disgusting. I think she takes her worship of Dibella a bit too seriously.
Do you know she's slept with three different men in the last month alone? What kind of a woman would do such a thing? Just for once, I'd like to see her squirm... to rub her nose in it.
Actually, there is a way to do this, but I don't think I could get away with doing it. She'd kill me if she found out. You see, I happen to know after she makes love, she gives her partner a token of her affection called a Mark of Dibella. If you confront her with three of the Marks of Dibella, she'd be so embarrassed... well, I don't know what she'd do!
Oh, this is going to be great! You need to get the Marks of Dibella from Bolli, Hofgrir and Indaryn. Not sure how you're going to do that, but try your best. Then just confront Haelga with them and the rest works itself out.

Dragonborn,
It has come to my attention you may have recently acquired a certain Dwemer sword from Warmaiden's.
I'm not sure how such an object came to find itself resting there... but I've been trying to obtain one for my research.
If you still have it, or if not, find another one, I would be most appreciative if you were to bring it to me here in Markarth. I will pay handsomely.

Sincerely,
Calcelmo

 I am Vex. I am a fellow member of the Thieves Guild. 
I have a little job for you. Pretty simple. Break into a house, grab a specific item and get out before they realize what's going on.

 I am Neloth. I am a wizard. Skyrim is a location. Skyrim is a realm.  is a location. 
I've been having difficulties with my heart stone experiments.
Have you heard of the Briarhearts? They are fierce warriors of the Forsworn tribes. They actually remove their own hearts, and replace them with large briar seeds. It puts their lifesparks in direct connection to the natural forces.
Well, I'm hoping to do something similar... if I could connect a living being to the forces of nature... well... that would be formidable. I've done some experiments in this area, but, well, my test subjects are far too fragile. I'm hoping to learn some of the Briarheart techniques, their methods.
I need you to examine one of them. Just investigate as much as you can. The Forsworn live in the hills on the western edge of Skyrim. From there, you're on your own. I'm given to understand that they are not difficult to find, if you gather my inference.

The Necromancer Malkoran defiles my shrine with vile corruptions, trapping lost souls left in the wake of this war to do his bidding. Worse still, he uses the power stored within my own token to fuel his foul deeds.
Mortals call my token Dawnbreaker, for it was forged in a holy light that breaks upon my foes, burning away corruption and false life. You will enter my shrine, destroy Malkoran, and retrieve this mighty blade.
I have brought you here, mortal, to be my champion. You will do this. I have commanded it!

A few days ago, some thieves from Riften broke in here and stole it! Can you imagine? Took the only thing of value we had. It was a family heirloom. I can't even put a price on how much that thing means to me.
I'm sure that they are from Riften. I bumped into them when I was coming back to my farm after buying supplies. I know those lowlifes took it with them back to the Ratway. They left an unmistakable stench behind.
If you have the guts to head into the Ratway and get my bow back, I'll pay you what I can. It would be nice to have it back... means a lot to me.

Whiterun is a location. Whiterun is a city. Olava the Feeble is present in Whiterun. Olava the Feeble is Gabriella's old female friend, and a powerful seer. 
Dear sibling. I've been waiting for you. Your next contract awaits, as I'm sure Astrid indicated.
With the Emperor's arrival in Skyrim now a certainty, his security service, the Penitus Oculatus, will need to begin its preparations immediately. Security is being handled by a Commander Maro. Astrid and I have devised a plan to break the man, and in doing so, cripple the Emperor's protection.
You are to slay the commander's son, Gaius Maro, and once he is dead, plant false evidence on his body implicating him in a plot to kill the Emperor. He is set to leave the Penitus Oculatus outpost at Dragon Bridge, and inspect the security of each city in Skyrim. Go there now. Observe Gaius Maro's departure, and follow him. Waylay him in one of the cities, and send his soul to Sithis. Once he's dead, plant the incriminating letter on his body, and let fate take care of the rest. Oh, and one final thing...
To earn your bonus, do not kill Gaius Maro in Dragon Bridge, or on the road. Kill him in one of the other major cities he'll be visiting. There, the body will be discovered quickly, as will the letter implicating Gaius Maro in the plot to assassinate the Emperor. Do that, and Astrid has authorized me to grant you a rather unique bonus. It is a special token, to be given to Olava the Feeble, in Whiterun. Olava is an old and dear friend, and a powerful seer. The token entitles you to a reading of your future. It's an opportunity one should not pass up.

Splendid. We're ready to begin. Or, more specifically, you're ready to begin. After all, you're the one the Night Mother spoke to.
Now then. I hope you have something nice to wear. Because you're going to a wedding. Well, more like the public reception. It should be a lovely affair. You'll mingle with the guests, eat some cake... stab the bride.
Oh yes. You've got to kill the bride. At her wedding. And they say romance is dead. Your target's name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude. The wedding is being held in that city, at the Temple of the Divines. Her death will cause an uproar, which is exactly what we want.
Vittoria Vici is the first cousin to our dear Emperor, Titus Mede II. Vici has obvious Imperial connections. Her husband has ties to the Stormcloaks. Their union is a step toward reconciliation. So if there's a murder at the wedding... Not only will it stall the peace process - it will send shockwaves throughout the entire Empire. The Emperor's hand will be forced. He'll have to travel to Skyrim to deal with the aftermath... and he'll find the Dark Brotherhood waiting.
Vici is likely to address her guests frequently, as is the wedding custom. Kill her when she does that, and I promise you a significant bonus.
Now go. And give the city of Solitude a celebration they're not likely to forget.

We are forged by Boethiah's example. We carve our will upon the world through our tongues and our blades. You? You are nothing. An empty vapor, dispersed by the slightest breeze.
If you desire a glimpse of Boethiah, our Dark Mistress, then this is what you must do. First, prove your tongue can wield a lie. Find someone. Gain his trust. Lead him to the shrine above. Next, instruct your thrall to touch the Pillar of Sacrifice. Its magic will ensnare him, rendering him helpless. Then, girded with certitude, plant the ceremonial blade deeply, so that the waters of his heart wash over you.
If your will is strong enough, it will stir Boethiah in her Dark Mansion, and she will appear before us.

Bah, I'm not afraid of anything out here. Walls are just a weakling's hiding spot. Now me, I'm no weakling. In fact, I bet I've got the strongest arms in all of Skyrim.
You bet against me? Oh! Sounds like I've got a challenger. Tell you what. How about a friendly wager, just between us. I bet you my entire purse of septims I can beat you in a fistfight. You match the bet and we fight until one of us gives in.
All right, remember... this is a clean fight. No weapons, no tricks. And none of those fancy magic spells, either. Here we go!

 I am Kodlak Whitemane. I am the player's guildleader in the Companions, and a Nord who wants to end up in Sovngarde. Sovngarde is a location. Sovngarde is the storied afterlife of heroic Nords. Hunting Grounds is a location. Hunting Grounds is Hircine's realm, a place where the player can hunt forever.  is a location. 
Have you heard the story of how we came to be werewolves?
The Companions are nearly five thousand years old. This matter of beastblood has only troubled us for a few hundred. One of my predecessors was a good, but short-sighted man. He made a bargain with the witches of Glenmoril Coven. If the Companions would hunt in the name of their lord, Hircine, we would be granted great power.
The Companions of old became werewolves. They did not believe the change would be permanent. The witches offered payment, like anyone else. But we had been deceived. The disease, you see, affects not just our bodies. It seeps into the spirit. Upon death, werewolves are claimed by Hircine for his Hunting Grounds. For some, this is a paradise. They want nothing more than to chase prey with their master for eternity. And that is their choice. But I am still a true Nord. And I wish for Sovngarde as my spirit home.
I've spent my twilight years trying to find a cure myself. And now I've found the answer. The witches' magic ensnared us, and only their magic can release us. They won't give it willingly, but we can extract their foul powers by force. I want you to seek them out. Go to their coven in the wilderness. Strike them down as a true warrior of the wild. And bring me their heads. The seat of their abilities. From there, we may begin to undo centuries of impurity.

Eldergleam is the ancient parent tree of the Gildergreen. Nettlebane is an object. Nettlebane is a weapon that can cut the Eldergleam. 
This is the Gildergreen. It was planted as a seedling in the early years of Whiterun. Disciples of Kynareth could sense something holy in it, and traveled far to hear the winds of the goddess in its branches. Of course, not as many pilgrims these days. A big dead tree isn't very inspiring if you're coming to worship the divine of wind and rains. Kynareth gives life, and we need a living tree to be her symbol.
I've thought about restoring the Gildergreen... Trees like this never really die. They only slumber. I think if we had some of the sap from the parent tree, Eldergleam, we could wake up its child. But even if you could get to the Eldergleam, you couldn't tap it. Not with any normal metal. If you want to help, you'll need something to cut into it first.
Eldergleam is older than metal, from a time before men or elves. To even affect it, you have to tap into the old magic. You'll have to deal with the Hagravens. I've heard about a weapon they've made for sacrificing Kynareth's creations. It's called "Nettlebane." The hags terrify me, or I would have gone after it myself. It's held in a Hagraven nest called Orphan Rock

I've visited their ancient burial mounds and found them empty. And I've figured out where the next one will come back to life. We're going to go there, and you're going to kill that dragon. If we succeed, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
We are going to Kynesgrove. There's an ancient dragon burial near there. If we can get there before the dragon comes back, maybe we'll learn how to stop it.

I, ah, learned of a certain stone tablet said to be housed in Bleak Falls Barrow - a 'Dragonstone,' said to contain a map of dragon burial sites. Go to Bleak Falls Barrow, find this tablet - no doubt interred in the main chamber - and bring it to me. Simplicity itself.

Helgird is present in Hall of the Dead. Helgird is a bit crazy woman who knows her dead bodies. Susanna is present in Hall of the Dead. Susanna is a barmaid from Candlehearth Hall, and the victim at the murder scene. 
Another girl killed. The victim is Susanna, from Candlehearth Hall. Served me a drink just a few nights ago... but I can't say I knew her.
She was killed the same way as the other two girls. Looks like she was stabbed, and then cut apart. It's like an animal got to her, but these are the wounds of a blade.
You could help us with the investigation. We're stretched thin as it is with the war. Nobody has the time to spend on this. Not pleasant, but it's the truth.
Here are some starting points for you. I noticed a trail of blood leading away from here. Helgird's taken Susanna's body into the Hall of the Dead to prepare for burial. She's a little crazy, but if she knows anything, it's dead bodies.

Azura has seen your coming, traveler. It was not curiosity, but fate, that has led you here.
Azura has given me the gift of foresight. I had a vision of you walking up the steps to this altar long before you were born. You have been chosen to be her champion. I know it is unexpected, but do not worry. It will all unfold as she has predicted.
You must go to a fortress, endangered by water, yet untouched by it. Inside, you will find an elven mage who can turn the brightest star as black as night. It is cryptic, I know, but Azura's signs are never wrong. I believe the fortress may refer to Winterhold. Ask if they know this elven enchanter.

The Black Book taught me the secrets. It shoved them in my head. With black slick fingers. My fingers are too short. I can't get them out. I didn't find the Black Book. It found me. Here. I'll show you. See. Right there, in White Ridge Barrow. But don't go there. You don't want these things in your head. You don't!

Ulfric thinks he can hide behind the walls of his castle. But we will fight our way in and drag him out through the rubble to face justice. Because this is the end for them, the Stormcloaks will fight like cornered rats. They will be fierce and crafty. But they are no match for Legionnaires.

Steal from anywhere in Whiterun, and you even get to keep everythin' you stole. So, you in?

 I am Neloth. I am a wizard, and a collector of magical staffs. Frostmere Depths is a location. Frostmere Depths is a cave. 
I have a slightly more personal request. You see, I'm a collector. Of staffs. Magical staffs. In particular, those made by Azra Nightwielder.
Azra Nightwielder was the original shadowmage. His advances in magic are legendary. Less well known is that he was also a pioneer in the field of enchanting staffs. Nightwielder's creations don't really hold up in comparison to what can be made today, but they have a sentimental value for me. You understand.
Through some divinations, I believe I've located one of Azra Nightwielder's staffs in Frostmere Depths. If you retrieve it, I'll give you a staff of my own making.

I'm not fussing over a simple pickaxe. No, no, no. This isn't just your run-of-the-mill pickaxe... I'm talking about an Ancient Nordic Pickaxe. They don't exactly grow on trees, you know.
An Ancient Nordic Pickaxe is the only tool tough enough to crack stalhrim, is what it is. Not many of those beauties left in the world... forging them is a lost art.

It may not be "official", but there is a, uhh, project I've been working on. I wonder if perhaps you could assist with it.
Just... Just bring me some Dwemer Cogs. I need to examine them for the methods used in forging them. Ten of them should be enough for me to get a better understanding of how they were crafted. That's all I need, all right?

The Dwemer, they were uhh, masters of magic in a way we can't even begin to conceive of. Their greatest achievement, however, has also been their greatest, shall we say... mystery.
This mystery is their disappearance, of course! Instant, unexplainable. The stories have fascinated me... Ever since I was young, I wanted to know what really happened. After years and years of work, I'm closing in on a way to investigate what happened through experimentation.
Only now... Well, it's simply a disaster. Without boring you with the, ahh, details, I am attempting to re-create the circumstances of the event. I used the soul gem you brought me for this. The soul gem by itself isn't enough, you see. It needs to be altered, purified. The Dwemer had machines for this sort of thing. I attempted to build my own, based on designs and using parts you helped to provide. My very own Dwemer machine. It worked, but not fully. And the uhh... The device was destroyed in the process.
The designs for my Convector were based on real Dwemer machines, so there may still be some in existence. I'd go looking myself, but uhh... Yes, there are calculations to double- and triple-check. Many calculations. Perhaps you could seek out these Convectors in Skyrim ruins? I can even teach you the spell to heat them.
Just place the soul gem inside, and heat the Convector. At least three seconds. You'll almost certainly need to find multiple Convectors. I suspect it may be due to the nature of the soul gem versus the crystals this was intended for. Destroys the equipment in the process.
But, ahh... It's effective. Three times, and the crystal should be ready for the next step. Isn't this exciting?

Legend says this tomb holds a treasure that bestows great power on the one who discovers it. Beyond that, not much more is known. Obviously, this treasure will fetch a good deal of gold, and I'm willing to let you share in the reward when we find it.

I've been working on something. An improvement on the Ebonyflesh spell. I've made progress, but then hit a snag. I think perhaps you could help.
I made some progress using the essence of dragon scales. But they're just not quite potent enough. My knowledge of history is far from complete, but I did some research and discovered two things.
First, there are ancient references to dragon "heartscales". What little I could learn suggests they may be what I need. Second, there are stories of a dagger called Kahvozein's Fang, said to be sharp enough to carve heartscales off a dragon.
First you'll need to retrieve the dagger, then use it to carve a few heartscales off a dragon. Presumably a deceased one.
If my research succeeds, I certainly think you deserve the first copy of the Dragonhide spell tome.

My Da locked me in there in a drunken rage when he left us... three days in there eating the offerings left for our dead before Aunt Agna found me.
I'll unlock the door and meet you inside, then you can lead the way. We should get after Vals Veran before he does more damage here.

I'm sure the Jarl will be quite pleased to. I think it only fitting that the Arch-Mage personally receive a large portion of the reward.

Wait... There's a courtyard in Castle Volkihar. I used to help her tend a garden there. All of the ingredients for our potions came from there. She used to say that my father couldn't stand the place. Too... peaceful. I don't think we'll actually trip over her there. But it's worth a look.

Here's the thing. We don't know where Florentius is. Haven't seen him in years. I think he had regular contact with the Vigilants, and I know Isran kept track of them... So maybe you could ask Isran if he knows anything?

Now, to your final task. If you truly wish to free the Guardian, you must humiliate my old rival, Ezrek Khan, by stealing his precious Lamp of Marvels.

We must act quickly. It appears that the Artificer you defeated in the Vaults has enslaved the Guardian of Mana for the enemy. The most pressing danger is that they will use the enslaved Guardian to corrupt... and control... all the world's magic. Our only recourse in that event may be to destroy the Guardian.
There might still be hope. If we can find a way to free the Guardian from Ezrohir's control, we can thwart the Alchemist's plans.

Finding the rest of the Alchemist's Journals would probably be very helpful in ascertaining how to stop him. The one I saw was volume four, so there are probably three more in the Icedeep Caverns.

There is a Crown, a... family heirloom that he stole from us. He will not give it up easily, of course. But this door is im-PENETRABLE - so you've got a much better chance with Thiss than you do waiting around here.
You can find Thiss in the Forgotten Halls... good luck! You're going to need it.

You've come here to fight ankhegs? Well, listen up: it's mating season, so it's primarily females coming up to the surface, looking to put on a little extra weight. They're hungry, they're aggressive, and there are a lot of them. Now, the point of this exercise is not to exterminate them, but to keep their population to a manageable level.

No more than four ankhegs per party. After that it's catch and release, all right? Most of the activity starts about fifty yards to the east.
Now move out, everyone. You'll get 75 gold pieces, if you stick to the quota.

Greetings, adventurer. I have, or perhaps I should say had, a son named Dalton. He fell in with a crew of adventurers from Waterdeep. Dalton was always obsessed with the idea of being a hero.
Alas, he has neither the brains nor the ability. Such is a mother's lot in life, however, to watch her children perform acts of idiocy despite her warnings or concerns.
He and his thick-skulled cohorts took it upon themselves to plumb the depths of Durlag's Tower. They bought a ward token from that shyster, Galken, and made ready to leave. Though I begged and cried, Dalton still insisted on going. The band never returned. I fear that they were destroyed by the mad dwarf's machinations. That is the tale, sad but true.
Please find my son if he still lives.

Forgive me. My name is Magreb. Rilsa and I have watched over this area for years, and we never had any trouble with goblins before. Since they killed her, I've been half out of my mind with grief.
Please avenge my Rilsa and give her a proper burial!

State your business with the guard and go! Oh, that came out a bit harsher than I meant. I am sorry for my mood. All the guard are still grieving the loss of Commander Brage.
The commander was friend to many before he found a cursed sword. He's not the man he was, by Helm. I'll not believe a man of Brage's rank could kill his own family. 'Twas evil magics of some sort. An entire unit went west after Brage to try to talk some sense to him. It's been a week, and none have returned.
The reward for the commander's head is a king's ransom, but I'll not be lifting MY sword against a brother soldier.
Travel lightly, wanderer. The woods harbor strange things.

It's refreshing to find other people in this wood. I am Coran, thief and archer!
I've been alone in the wilderness for far too long. I wouldn't mind returning to the big city, but I have yet to collect my bounty. I'd share the reward with the lot of you if you would help hasten the hunt.
The deal is this: I've been hired out by the mayor of Beregost to hunt down a great winged dragon that's been plaguing the caravan routes. He's offered 2,000 gold for its head. Now before you get cold feet, let me allay your fears. The only descriptions of the beast have always mentioned its deadly barbed tail. From what I know about dragons they don't have barbs on their tails — that's something unique to wyverns. So all we have to do is find this wyvern's nest and kill it. Our only worries are if it has friends over for dinner!
We shouldn't tarry any longer; let's collect the head of this soon-to-be-sorry wyvern.

Well, I have a proposal that could help you in that endeavor. You see, there's a girl, my lover in fact, who desires to escape her father and live on her own. Her father is Entar Silvershield, one of the dukes of Baldur's Gate. This, of course, makes her desires more difficult than that of the average city girl.
However, with your assistance, we could help her escape the tyrannical clutches of Entar. Here's the punchline: Since Entar's going to be hunting us anyway, we can blackmail him for hoards of cash and not worry about our captive escaping. After all, we're doing it all for the sake of Skie.
Now, we needn't go about this right away. In fact, I'll help you with whatever you're doing until you decide to head up to Baldur's Gate. Just think of it as one favor deserving another.

It is I, Scar, second-in-command of the Flaming Fist. I have another job you might be interested in. You'll be well paid for your services.
The problem is this: Every night people have been disappearing from the streets of the city. My men have been scouring the city trying to find the culprit, but so far to no avail. People have begun to get scared, and very few are willing to leave their homes at night. Something has to be done, and quickly. Would you be willing to take the job? I'd pay you 300 gold in advance with a 1,000 gold bonus if you discover what's been happening with the disappearing citizens.
Your job is really simple. All I want you to do is patrol the east of the city and find an entrance to the sewers. Perhaps you'll get lucky and find out what's been happening. If you do find out what's been happening, come to see me at the Flaming Fist barracks. Our only clue so far has led us to the sewers, so if you want to explore them first, it would probably be a good idea. Also, we've found tracks of some many-legged creature, perhaps a centipede-like monster.

I am Aldeth Sashenstar. You must understand that at the moment, I'm under a terrible amount of stress.
You see, my dear friend, there is a group of uncouth savages that has declared their intention of killing my friends and me. I've been holed up in this cabin for several days and have lacked the wherewithal to try to make an escape.
My friends and I come here every year to do some sport hunting. This year however, a group of woodland savages threatened us with bodily harm if we did not stop our hunting trip. Being civilized men, we realized that it's well within our rights to hunt where we damn well please. After a few more days of hunting, the crass woodmen lost all pretense of humanity and murdered Elban, one of my oldest friends.
I'm sure that they plan to attack our cottage here, so we had best be prepared.

I'm sorry for all of this hiding and skulking, but there are dire events afoot. You know that I am one of the principal shareholders of the Merchants' League. Well, I share ownership of the company with two others: Irlentree and Zorl Miyar, two very distinguished gentlemen. When I returned from my hunting trip — thanks to you, I might add — I found that my two partners had undergone some profound changes, nothing physical or overt, but something far more sinister.
It's as if my partners had become wholly different people while I was gone. They almost take an active interest in squandering our company's resources on frivolous and stupid ideas. If they continue on this course, the company will be in shambles in but a few weeks. I know you have already helped me once, but I ask for your assistance again. I have no other recourse.
Come into the Merchants' League Estate with me. I will explain that you are an old friend of mine and will quarter you in the guest chambers. From there, please investigate my partners, perhaps using magic or any of the other skills you possess. Learn as much as you can during your visit and then report back to me after you're done. It should only take a couple of days.

I would be careful in this place, if I were you. Many dangers around many corners. You will be lucky to live. No real secrets for those that travel here frequently.
A trespasser got his due from someone he crossed. Well, I suppose it did not end in death, but it was a mighty battle regardless. I do not know who the aggressor was, but I know who lost.
That person was a mage of power, I am sure, though not powerful enough in the end. A pity too. He seemed intent on unearthing an artifact of old or some such.
And his reward for his effort? Worse than death, even though he seemed willing to share. Imprisoned, magically confined in the cavern north of here. Pity.

Ahh! Thank you for releasing me. I'm Vithal, an adventuring mage. If you could aid me a bit, I would be forever grateful. There will be items enough for us both.
This spot is "thin," and careful spells may breach the walls between dimensions. On the other side, one might find some valuable magic, if one knows where to look. I cannot cast the actual dimension-breaching spells without the procedures outlined in my book of rituals. I imagine it was taken after I was imprisoned. There were svirfneblin observing my conflict: Perhaps they took it. I cannot blame them. I am sure I appeared quite permanently lost.
I believe there is a svirfneblin village to the north. They may have taken my gear there. If you go, tell them they may keep everything but the book.

Athkatla is blessed with the presence of perhaps the greatest sculptor of our age. The artist is known as Sir Sarles, and he is making an all too brief visit. We would be foolish not to seize upon the opportunity to have him work for us.
I would ask you to convince Sir Sarles that it would be best for him to work for us. Go to him now.

Good day, it's Dawnbringer Sain, the priest of Lathander.
I would ask a dangerous thing of you. You're free to refuse, but the greater glory of Lathander is at stake.
The Morninglord takes great pride in the artifacts of his rule. We have many items on display at the temple of Lathander, from new artworks to the aged relics of bygone days. Today we are one less. We are the victims of thievery, and our followers have been shaken by this vulnerability. Quick steps must be taken to rectify this.
We know the culprits; they have not concealed their crime. Talassans, slinking from their temple to degrade our worship, hired common thieves for the deed! They fear no retribution. The Morninglord cannot suffer his relics in the hands of such evil.
Find these thieves before the Talassans receive the items.
The spark of dawn has lit the way.
Go to the filth of the slums at night and intercept the delivery of our Dawn Ring. Bring it back to its proper place.

I, Talon Yarryl, priest of Talos, have a mission for you!
Talos demands proper tribute, and that occasionally means artwork pleasing to the eye. If a piece of his fury can be represented, more might see and fear it.
An artist visits Athkatla now. The artist travels under the name Sir Sarles, though it is surely a fake. He is pretentious, demanding, and very good.
We must command a commission from him. But he is not being cooperative. His commission is outlandish, and he demands illithium as his medium! He may as well have asked for dragon tears.
Convince him to work for Talos. Use whatever means you must. Other churches are trying the same... if you cross their representatives, kill them.
Incur what debts you must, and use force where it will help. Stop at nothing. This man must realize there is no choice but to work in the service of Talos.

This is not a matter of negotiation or exploration. No, now you are to face true enemies of Talos.
Slanderous words have been said. Things did not go well for Stormherald Nallabir at this past tenday's theological debate in the Government District. The growing arrogance of the Lathanderian church is distasteful. Talos should be feared; their irreverence is insulting.
We have hired a thief, and he has stolen a Dawn Ring from the Lathanderian temple.
Find Travin in the slums at night, collect the ring, and return it here.
Remember that the honor of Talos rests upon your shoulders.

A group of Dao genies from Calimshan arrived to Trademeet a while ago. They and their gold were welcome enough at first... But in only weeks, they have taken all business and put a stop to it. They are hunting a rakshasa named Ihtafeer and insist that she is present in the town.
The genies will allow no trade to occur until Ihtafeer is found and her head given to them. Why... why they have chosen this particular tactic, I am unsure.
Without proper trade, however, the merchants are penniless. Soon, the food resources will dry up as well, so something must be done... and done soon.

I am working on a golem of stone! A fine piece of magical craftsmanship, if I do say so myself! Few other mages have made the attempt, you see. This type of golem is quite powerful and dangerous... but I am more than skilled enough to control it. Once it's complete, I'll have an excellent servant.
Trouble is, I'm missing one of the crucial ingredients... the blood of a mimic. I'd pay handsomely for some, in fact. Hmmm... you look like the adventurous type... care to find me some?
Hmm. I seem to recall that I've got a magical sword around here that I won in a bet from a certain fool. I've no use for it, but it's valuable. Find me some mimic's blood and it's yours.

One of my guild houses to the south is run by a rather ambitious fellow named Mae'Var. Good thief, but I never liked him. Now I know why. I've had some hints that he is getting too big for himself. Thinking of taking my place, I suspect, but I've had no real evidence to say that this is so.
I will give you papers saying you were being transferred by the Shadowmaster. You will spy on Mae'Var from the inside and find me the evidence that I need. You'll need to reassure Mae'Var, naturally. He won't know who you are, but I am confident that you are more than capable of this.
Just head to the storefront in the central docks area and speak to the storekeeper, Gorch. Show the papers to him, and he'll let you in the guild house proper.
I think you will find the reward adequate. 10,000 gold is no small fortune, though I think you deserve a little more. From my personal armory, a sword.

There is no time! I only hope that the attackers have not made it inside. If they have... if they have breached the inner courtyard, they will be hard to rout.
I will tell you what secrets I can. Perhaps you will be able to sneak in and attack from a more vulnerable spot. I hope Father is all right. He... would not leave.
Please, hurry to the de'Arnise Keep and find Daleson.

 I am Khellor Ahmson. I am a guard.  is a location.  is a location. the Government District main building is a location. Corgeig Axehand is present in the Government District main building. Corgeig Axehand is Officer Roenall's commander. Barg is present in the docks. Barg is a suspicious man. 
I am Khellor Ahmson, a mere guard.
I saw what happened, and I share your helplessness. Any complaints about Officer Roenall must first go THROUGH him, so you can imagine how many get through.
This did not come from me, for if my indiscretion against Roenall were to get out, I should be thrown from the military. There is one way you can get to him.
Roenall is quite corrupt and more than willing to exercise his power. You are not monitored as we, so you can do something that I or another guard cannot.
Look to the docks and a man named Barg. Examine him and what he does, and you are sure to see what I mean. You might also wish to pry into Roenall's personal records. They may reveal something of his fondness for gems. I did not tell you this... and I certainly did not say his records are in his home northwest of the main government building in the Government District.
Think on what I've said, and bring anything you learn to Corgeig Axehand in the Government District main building. He is Roenall's commander.

Welcome. I, William Reirrac, have been awaiting you. You should know the particulars of your service here and what being a member of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart really means.
You are aware of the conflict with the Sythillisian Empire? There have been invasions into Amnian lands. We have been monitoring outposts, and all is not well. One outpost reported an imminent attack because an enemy unit needed their supplies. A runner barely made it with the information, and we fear the worst.
You must leave immediately for the furthest lengths of the Umar Hills. You must join the combat and rescue our knights, for they are surely outnumbered.
Go, and rescue whom you can. You have little time.

I have a vital mission for you that must take precedence over all else.
We have received word of a great atrocity, one that must not be completed. There has been... murder is too weak a word. An entire family has been decimated. The Morningales have been a model of decency in this city, and their work in opposing the slave trade has earned them renown across the land. It also earned them many enemies. This past tenday has seen the family murdered in their homes, almost to the last. It would seem they were made examples of.
The time for justice will come, but what is important now is that someone survived, praise Helm. Tyrianna — she hid in a cellar while all others were executed. She must be protected until escorted from the city. Her survival will be a symbol to persevere in the fight against slavery, despite the ferocity of the enemy. You will go to a safe house we have set up, and you will make sure she remains secure. It is as secret as we could make it, though nothing is ever absolute.
In the morning, her godparent will arrive. He is from Baldur's Gate and will accept no other guards besides his own. You will see that she reaches his care. Go to the building beside the temple in the docks and await him. She should be safe in his care. Hurgis Baltezan is his name, and a more upright citizen you will not find. He earned the title "Hand of Torm" in his service to the god of duty.
The Order shall reward you with a suit of powerful armor for your good works.

His reign must end, and from his lair you must retrieve the most holy of blades, the Holy Avenger. This tool of good has been in his possession for too long. Knight, I call upon you to slay the dragon and make a statement for right and justice.
The blade will be rescued, but so shall the lands that he rules. This is a great risk, but it must be dealt with sometime. Go, and may the forces of good be your salvation.
Accomplish this, and I can think of no one more worthy of wielding the Holy Avenger. In your hands, such a blade will strike deep to evil's heart.

Greetings, Your Grace. I actually have a rather angry merchant by the name of Tolmas Bendelia that has been demanding to see you.
It might have something to do with his caravan being waylaid by bandits passing through the region, but he refuses to speak to anyone but Your Grace. He is an influential merchant in this area; I believe he owns the deed to more than one local farmhold. Will you grant this man an audience, my liege? I shall show him in.

I am not sure if you have been aware, but we have been experiencing a number of thefts in the keep over the past couple of weeks. A goblet, some silverware, a few coins from the servants' quarters. All of these things have value, although none of them were major thefts.
Still... I investigated. Lastin here is one of the new guards. I caught him red-handed, attempting to take a necklace that belonged to the late Lady de'Arnise. Lastin has confessed his crime. I am unsure how to punish him, my liege, so I have brought this before you.
He is your subject, my liege, so yours is the right to decide punishment, but you are also... being watched carefully by those who oppose your rule, however.

I've come to ask if you've a chapel that a priest of Tempus might set himself up in... bring the good Word to the folk of the area.
What do you say, eh? If my manner does not strike you as offensive, I would be glad to be chaplain of your wee keep here. I can help your people here much while I stay.

Greetings, Your Grace. It is I, the majordomo of your castle. We have a small problem here at the keep, one that I doubt that you would be aware of at all.
I am unsure if you have met Chanelle... She has been a maid here most of her life. She was an orphan, and the de'Arnise family took her in as a servant when she was young. As the ruler of the keep, you are technically her guardian. Ordinarily, that would not be a problem, but there are two men who desire her hand in marriage. It is... up to you, my liege, to give her away and decide which of the men has your blessing for the marriage.
I shall bring them in to see you, my liege. If you do not resolve this issue, then... no one shall be permitted to marry Chanelle. And I am sure that is not what she wants.

Greetings, greetings, greetings! I am Higgold, director of fine theatricals, musicals, and other entertainments. Most recently from Calimport, where I needn't return quickly due to the sensitivity of one particular huzzah...
..but we needn't get into that. Now, let's see... yes, mm-hm... yes, this looks like a fine playhouse. I know a few actors that aren't working, but it'll take some time to find them, as well as a worthy play to put into production. A week for that, I think. About six weeks after that for rehearsing and then this playhouse of yours should start making decent coin, so long as all goes well.
Your part, my good friend, is to provide the investment to stage the play as well as make important decisions. You'll also reap the majority of the profits. I'll start looking for actors and a play right away. It shouldn't take more than half a week, and I'll send word as soon as I'm ready to go.

It is good to see you again, my patron. I have managed to gather together a play as well as a troupe of actors, as I promised.
They are a fine lot. I have worked with some, and they should serve well. As for the play, I have come across a translated copy of, uh, "The Sorcerer's Bane." You will like it, my patron. A grand epic about the pride of a great sorcerer and the love that is his downfall. Seldom performed, but well attended when it is.
The only problem I am having is deciding who will play Karenina, the lead female role. There are two actresses in the troupe who are desperate for the part. I know them both well and cannot decide, so I shall leave the choice to you. Here... I shall introduce you to both of them, as well as the rest of the actors.

A cistern broke and ruined an entire backdrop! An actress slipped yesterday and almost broke her foot! There's been other strange things, too... noises during the night, creakings and moanings. One of the stagers almost died falling out of the rafters!
All the actors are frightened; they believe the curse is assailing us, and I... am beginning to believe it too. Oh, what a fool I was to disregard it!
You are the patron of the playhouse... I need you to talk to someone who has offered to help.

He cannot even move from his bed! I see only one chance... it's too late for anything else... You must play Velden. You are a bard, naturally gifted... you observed our rehearsals.
Please, my patron, I'm begging you! This could be the biggest chance for all of us! And... and we mustn't upset the council member! PLEASE, you must do it!

Belgrade is a male merchant who helped to expose Ployer for his crimes. Bernard is present in Copper Coronet. Bernard is a male bartender. 
Ployer! That... that fat excuse for a slaver, he's cursed me! Damn him! If the curse was tailored to me, it might resist removal by normal means. I doubt Ployer would have done this if the solution were simple.
I have a few options. Ployer mentioned that he lived in squalor, suggesting he may be in the poor section of the city. Not likely to find him quick though. The mages with him wore odd colors that might be traceable. Ask at the government building, as all magic is regulated in Athkatla. If they will talk... He also mentioned Belgrade, a merchant that helped expose Ployer. He frequents the Copper Coronet, and the bartender Bernard might know his whereabouts.
My very bones ache today. It is as though I age on the inside. Ohh, this cannot go on for long. We must remove this curse!

 I am Sir Ryan Trawl. I am from the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. Bridge District is a location. Bridge District is a city district. 
Greetings, traveler. I am Sir Ryan Trawl. I have heard of you. I would like to offer you the opportunity to help the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart.
The task of being a paladin is not easy. Many break under the demands of our path and leave to pursue avenues of life more appropriate to their talents. Sometimes they bend instead of break, twisting their paladinhood to serve their own purpose. These are hard to detect, but when found, they are quickly cast out.
Recently, one of our highest-ranking officers was implicated in smuggling slaves. His name is Anarg, and though he was once a friend, he was expelled from the Order. We thought that the end of it, but Anarg took others when he left. He is a charismatic man, and some of the younger knights were swayed by his words. We could tolerate their loss, but they masquerade as paladins, abusing our good name. They extort, smuggle slaves, and spit on all that we honor. The Fallen Paladins, as they're known, would recognize any of our Order, and some also fear conflict with former friends, so we need outside help in this matter.
The Fallen Paladins always need warriors to aid their illegal activities. We want you to ally with them, especially Anarg. He's the key to them all. If you consider these men a threat, then do what you think is necessary. Gloves of Healing would be a suitable reward for the task, I think.
Anarg has kept their activities localized in the Bridge District. I suggest you search there. May Torm be with you.

I'm Lieutenant Aegisfield. I'm warning everyone so as to get the word out that there are guards on the streets. We've had a... a string of killings, and I don't want any more happening.
Bandits I can understand; they are easy enough to figure out. What's happening here is... it's murder, but not like I've ever seen. There's a disgustingly sick person out there, and I simply don't have the manpower to protect everyone. He's been killing paupers, sometimes in the alley where they sleep. They have nothing to take. He kills them and that is all. Not only is it pointless, but he does it in as painful a way as possible. It's... it's sick. He flays them... alive. There has been blood all over the area.
I must go about my rounds. If you find any information about the murders, be sure to let me know. Don't go looking for trouble though.

 I am Lord Skarmaen. I am a nobleman who hates Lilith, one of the Alibakkars. Trademeet is a location. Lord Skarmaen is present in Trademeet. Trademeet is a location. Trademeet is a town.  is a location. Lilith is present in Trademeet. Lilith is a noblewoman, one of the Lurraxols. Mantle of Waukeen is an object. Mantle of Waukeen is a large circlet. 
Hello once again!
It is pleasing to see that you did not respond to the call of that harlot, Lilith Lurraxol. The woman is too deluded to see the truth, as I said. A commoner that has risen above her station. Our two houses have been feuding for generations. The Lurraxols seem to be possessed of the notion that their family founded this town... what an absurd thought!
Why they would even presume to suppose such a thing, I have no idea. It is sad, however, that the Alibakkars have never had the evidence to prove our claim to them... though it galls me that we would need it. All that has recently changed. An old tome belonging to my family states that there is proof — that proof can be found right here in Trademeet. In the graveyard is a tomb that has been long abandoned... but which also houses the founder of the town. My ancestor. With him lies a large circlet called the Mantle of Waukeen.
Possessing that circlet would be all the proof I need, so I wish to acquire it. I would do so myself, but there happens to be a good reason the tomb is abandoned. It is... haunted, so they say. The exact nature of its danger I do not know... but you are a hero who surely could face its perils and return safely with the mantle, yes? In return, I shall pay you 1,000 gold. I shall give you the key, then, which will allow you into the tomb... the key itself having been in my family for some time as well. More proof, yes? Go, then, and return with the mantle.

Trademeet is a town.  is a location. Skarmaen is present in Trademeet. Skarmaen is a nobleman from the Alibakkar family. Mantle of Waukeen is an object. Mantle of Waukeen is an old gold circlet. 
Ah! It is the hero of Trademeet, come to see me at last. I trust that all is well? That pig, Skarmaen Alibakkar, did not speak too harshly about me, I trust? No matter. He is a stubborn, deluded fool. Our families have been at odds for generations, you see. The Alibakkars refuse to acknowledge the fact that we are the only true noble family in Trademeet, having founded it. Why they would think themselves higher than they are is beyond my ken. What is unfortunate, however, is that my family has never had actual, physical proof of the truth of our claim.
That has changed, however. A tome has recently been uncovered... an old tome belonging to my family... that states there is proof right here in Trademeet under our noses. In the graveyard, here in town, lies the crypt of the founder... my ancestor. With him lies the Mantle of Waukeen. A pretty name for an old gold circlet. That circlet, however, would prove my claim once and for all and shut those Alibakkars up. I would get it myself, but the tomb is haunted, you see. Here is the key to the tomb... the fact that we possess it is yet more proof of our legitimacy. Use it to enter and obtain the mantle, and then return to me when you are done.
You are a hero who might enter that tomb and retrieve the circlet for me, if you are willing. In return, I will pay you 1,000 gold. What do you say, my hero?

You will rescue him. He will be killed once they are through, so go quickly. They have him at the Shadow Thief guild house on the second floor. You know the building, I think? The man's name is Palern Flynn. Remember, if he dies, you fail.
Good luck.

 I am Bodhi. I am a well-spoken woman who hates the Shadow Thieves.  is a location. Senior Armagaran Vulova's small house is a location. Senior Armagaran Vulova is present in Senior Armagaran Vulova's small house. Senior Armagaran Vulova is a man leading a merchant house, linked to the Shadow Thieves. 
Now I ask for a more specific task that will disrupt the Shadow Thieves further.
The task is... unseemly.
It calls for the murder of a man. Not a truly innocent man, but hardly a villain of epic scope. You must kill, blaming the murder on the Shadow Thieves. He is head of a merchant house, and his link to Shadow Thieves is blatant. If he were to die and certain gear were at the scene, it would implicate the guild we oppose.
Take this cloak and dagger, and go kill Senior Armagaran Vulova. When he is dead, put the cloak and dagger in the fountain in his house. He will die easily, though there may be guards. His small house is in the Government District, between the jail and the government building.
Go.

 I am Bodhi. I am a well-spoken woman, and an enemy to the Shadow Thieves.  is a location. Aran Linvail's sanctum is a location. Aran Linvail, the Shadowmaster is present in Aran Linvail's sanctum. Aran Linvail, the Shadowmaster is the male leader of the Shadow Thieves. 
Again, I require your talents. Now to the task at hand.
It is time to take down the leadership of the Shadow Thieves and throw them into a more permanent disarray from which they may not recover. You must invade their lair one last time. You must kill Aran Linvail, the Shadowmaster. Do this for me, and our arrangement will be fulfilled.
Aran is in the basement of the Shadow Thief guild house, so you need a key. The lock is likely unpickable. What good is a lock in a thieves' guild if any thief can pick it?
One more thing: Tizzak, an employee of mine, is missing, and the Thieves may have him. Find him, and he may tell you how to access Aran's sanctum. Go now!

 I am Madeen. I am a representative of Tolgerias. Athkatla is a location. Athkatla is a city.  is a location. Tolgerias is present in the government building behind Madeen. Tolgerias is a man, and one of the masters of the Athkatla order of the Cowled Wizards. 
Greetings. I am Madeen. I represent one of the masters of the Athkatla order of the Cowled Wizards. He seeks to employ you in a matter of some urgency.
The matter is most sensitive... I have been given little knowledge of it. Tolgerias, the one whom I speak for, is eager to meet with you and discuss these matters.
Master Tolgerias can be found in the government building behind me... you may go within. Do not tarry overlong, my friend.

I am Tolgerias, a proud member of the Amnian Cowled Wizards.
This matter must be handled with discretion and expediency. There is something that has been plaguing us for more than a week now and has become quite alarming.
You know of the prevailing attitude against magic here in Amn, yes? Well, amongst some it is even worse than that... a burning, palpable hatred. One particular man here in Athkatla has murdered two of our number in cold blood. He is currently in hiding, and we need you to track the fellow down. We have been unable to do so, much to our frustration. Cowled Wizards cannot be assaulted without repercussions or it will lead to... serious problems.
He is Valygar Corthala, last son of a wealthy family and a true brute. Ask around and you may discover if he is hiding within the city or someplace else. He has a home here in the Docks District, or he may have fled to the Umar Hills. His friends and servants will not speak to us, but they may to you.
We do not ask that you commit any murder. We wish Valygar be delivered to us, that is all. He will likely resist, so if you must kill him, so be it. But if you do kill him, I simply must have his body. Valygar must be delivered to us whether he is dead or alive. You understand, yes?

My name is Ama, and I am Shadowmaster of Eastern Esmeltaran.
I would like you to participate in a little rendezvous and help in the removal of a pest. There is a government official, Sir Greshal, causing us no end of trouble with his tariffs and spot checks on caravans. This fool thinks he can stifle the thieving trade of an entire city. He has been trying to muscle into a relationship with the Shadow Thieves, and while we could pay, it is better that we send a message to any of his cohorts. I have come here with a promise of granting his wishes, but I only want to lure him away from his palisade defenses. This is where you come in.
Sir Greshal wishes to be introduced to a contact here in the city, and that contact will be you. The meeting is already set up, and when he arrives, we will take him by surprise. You are known somewhat in this place, if not as a guildmaster. He will believe you are a legitimate contact. He seems willing to believe anything, so long as it is theatrical.
It will be any evening that is best for you. I will await you in Waukeen's Promenade after dark and then dispense a runner to get Sir Greshal. The suddenness will seem dramatic to him.

Maybe it's the wild mage in me comin' out, but I can't stand not tastin' something new once in a while. Most dwarves will drink the same mountain swill from crib to dust-crib, but I'm always hankering for the latest brew. Old Vyatri in Trademeet was just getting a shipment from Luiren I'd dearly love to sample. If ye happen to run by his place in yer travels, get a cask of it for me and I'll pay ye well!
Can't wait to taste it. Halfling's Help, it's called — I hope it works on dwarves, too

 I am Captain Samand. I am captain of the Saradush guard. Saradush is a location. Saradush is a town under siege.  is a location. Mateo is present in Mateo's cell. Mateo is a young man, and a faithful soldier. Kiser Jhaeri is present in Saradush. Kiser Jhaeri is a vile male merchant. Countess Santele is present in Saradush. Countess Santele is a noblewoman. 
My name is Captain Samand, and I'm a very busy man right now.
A few days ago, someone opened a secret gate into the town — Saradush could easily have been overrun. We just discovered the traitor was a young man named Mateo. There's no doubt in my mind that *someone* betrayed us. The enemy came through a small sewer outlet that was protected by both a locked iron grate and several powerful magical wards. There is no way to open that entrance from the outside. But Mateo is a faithful soldier, not the type of man to betray Saradush.
An alarm was raised, and my soldiers arrived only a few moments after the gate was opened. We found three soldiers in the area: Mateo, Ardic Santele, and the merchant Kiser Jhaeri. We didn't get a chance to complete our investigations. Ardic, the son of the Countess Santele, disappeared. He was our primary witness. Our attention was focused on the vile Kiser Jhaeri, but we had no proof. Then the countess told us that Ardic, her son, had implicated Mateo before he disappeared.
If you wish to investigate further, I will not stand in your way. Speak to Mateo in his cell. The jailer will let you see him.

Tankard Tree is a location. Tankard Tree is the local pub. Hectan is present in Tankard Tree. Hectan is a known thief. 
Lazarus Librarus at your service. I would normally invite you to look at my magical wares, but alas, my shelves are completely bare. I have not even a single parchment left for you to purchase.
My spellbook has been stolen! Without it, I cannot fashion the powerful scrolls which normally fill my shop. Please, mighty traveler... I beg of you to help a humble wizard! At first, I suspected Hectan... he is well known about town for his sticky fingers. But after questioning many witnesses, it is clear that Hectan was at the local pub from dusk until dawn the night of the theft. I still suspect that no-good thief Hectan was involved — I can clearly see the guilt in his face! But there is no proof. Without my spellbook, I am virtually powerless to pursue this myself, and as a newcomer to this town, I have no one to turn to for help.
I regret that there is little else I can tell you. Hectan can usually be found in the Tankard Tree if you wish to question him.
I urge you godspeed.

We are elven refugees in dire need of help!
We have nowhere to stay... we have no choice but to wander the streets. I fear we will soon run into trouble with the soldiers of this town.
We have no money, and the innkeeper turned us away because he feared our wives would draw unwanted attention from the soldiers. Who else would have the heart and the room to take us all in?
Perhaps you can find someone willing to take us in? We would be truly thankful for your help.

I would not bother you, stranger, but I am in terrible peril! I need your aid! I beg you for a boon or I and my daughter both shall surely perish! I... cannot speak more of this here. Please come to my home on top of the cliff, I beg you! We can speak freely there!

Malla is Marlowe's daughter, and a pure, young girl. 
Welcome to my humble accommodations, adventurer. Will you hear out my tale?
As I said before, my name is Marlowe... I hail from Calimshan to the south, where I was a merchant. A successful one. I... suppose that is where I first came into contact with Vongoethe.
Vongoethe is a lich, adventurer. A powerful one. In Calimshan, there are many strange wonders of magic, and Vongoethe is not out of place. It is he who has chased us here, hunting us mercilessly. Vongoethe desired my poor Malla, my daughter. She is the young woman here on the bed. A... a good girl, a virgin and pure of heart. He desired her soul, he said, so I fled Calimshan with her. But he caught up to us nevertheless. And somehow he has taken her soul despite my efforts! She... she lies near death, and there is nothing the local priestess can do to help her. I know Vongoethe is in the cavern that serves as a graveyard in this place. I told the monks about him... but they sealed off the cavern rather than somehow getting my daughter's soul back as I had hoped.
Malla is the world to me! And I do not know how much longer Vongoethe will remain trapped in that cavern... he could already be loose! He will kill me and keep Malla's soul, I am sure of it!
Getting inside the cavern is not a problem. I... paid the guard there what little money I have left. I had thought to... try and get Malla's soul myself. But the guard will let in whomever I ask him to.
I have no coin left to offer you. I have bankrupted myself in trying to flee the lich's reach. But... Vongoethe himself is a powerful wizard. Surely he has items that would interest you, that you could take from him!

Welcome to this place. I've looked forward to seeing you. I am, as you know, Aran Linvail.
Strange things are afoot on the docks. Shipments are disappearing, as are my employees with them. We are significantly weakened by this. I think it unlikely you would be captured or wooed to the enemy. If you go to the docks and bolster the guard on the shipments, it will strengthen our position.
Go at night, and you will find my present guard captain there already, a woman by the name of Mook. Take note of anything odd that happens.
Good hunting. Report to me if anything happens. Oh, and the reward I have set aside for you... I'll let you have some magical items. You will find them useful, I am sure.

They are to meet their contact on the second floor of the Five Flagons tavern in the Bridge District. Go there and pose as one of our enemy's new recruits. I want to know where our enemy's lair is. We have yet to find it.
This recruiter could arrive at any time so I suggest that you go to the Five Flagons now. They may prove unreasonable, so prepare yourself for hostility.
Return when you have the information we need.

Bodhi is an intelligent, brutal female vampire, and the leader of the rival guild. 
You were not the only one who was busy last night.
The leader of this rival guild, Bodhi by name, made a daring attack upon us. She can only be a vampire, and I suspect many of her servants are as well. The time has come to strike back to protect our people and the city she has invaded.
Go to the Graveyard District and find their hideout. There is a network of tombs beneath the graves where another spy tracked one of Bodhi's servants. There you shall find a set of blue doors just north of a spider den. The doors are too heavy for any mortal to open, but the vampires likely pass with ease. I shall send a mage to meet you there and arrange for the doors to be opened. Here, you shall need these stakes if you are to truly finish these creatures.
Be on your guard. This Bodhi is the most intelligent and brutal foe I have ever had. If we are lax in our vigilance, we will be at the disadvantage. When you have destroyed their evil, return to me and I will fulfill our bargain.
