When the husband's wife has a baby girl, a sorceress takes a baby girl to raise as a sorceress's own and names a baby girl's "Rapunzel" after the plant a baby girl's mother craved. a baby girl grows up to be the most beautiful child in the world, with long golden hair. When a baby girl turns twelve, a sorceress locks a baby girl up inside a tower in the middle of the woods, with neither stairs nor a door, and only one room and one window. In order to visit a baby girl, a sorceress stands beneath a tower in the middle of the woods, with neither stairs nor a door, and only one room and one window and calls out:

    a baby girl!
    Rapunzel!
    Let down a baby girl's hair
    That a sorceress may climb thy golden stair!

One day, a prince rides through the woods and hears a baby girl singing from a tower in the middle of the woods, with neither stairs nor a door, and only one room and one window. Entranced by a baby girl's ethereal voice, a prince searches for a baby girl and discovers a tower in the middle of the woods, with neither stairs nor a door, and only one room and one window, but is naturally unable to enter a tower in the middle of the woods, with neither stairs nor a door, and only one room and one window. a prince returns often, listening to a baby girl's beautiful singing, and one day sees a sorceress visit, and thus learns how to gain access to a baby girl. When a sorceress leaves, a prince bids a baby girl let a baby girl's hair down. When a baby girl does so, a prince climbs up and they fall in love. a prince eventually asks a baby girl to marry a prince, which a baby girl agrees to.

Together they plan a means of escape, wherein a prince will come each night, and bring a baby girl a piece of silk, which a baby girl will gradually weave into a ladder. Before a means of escape, wherein he will come each night, and bring Rapunzel a piece of silk, which she will gradually weave into a ladder can come to fruition, however, a baby girl foolishly gives a prince away. In the first edition of Kinder- und Hausm√§rchen, a sorceress innocently says that a sorceress's dress is growing tighter around a sorceress's waist; in later editions, a sorceress asks a sorceress why it is easier for a sorceress to draw up a prince than a sorceress. In anger, a sorceress cuts off a majority of a baby girl's hair and casts a baby girl out into the wilderness to fend for a baby girl.

When a prince calls that night, a sorceress lets a majority of Rapunzel's hair down to haul a prince up. To a prince's horror, a prince finds a prince meeting a sorceress instead of a baby girl. After a sorceress tells a prince in a rage that a prince will never see a baby girl again, a prince leaps or falls from a tower in the middle of the woods, with neither stairs nor a door, and only one room and one window, landing in a thorn bush. Although a thorn bush breaks a prince's fall and saves a prince's life, a thorn bush scratches a prince's eyes and blinds a prince.

For years, a prince wanders through the wastelands of the country and eventually comes to the wilderness where a baby girl now lives with the twins to whom a baby girl has given birth, a boy and a girl. One day, as a baby girl sings, a prince hears a baby girl's voice again, and they are reunited. When they fall into each other's arms, a baby girl's tears immediately restore a prince's sight. a prince leads a baby girl and their twins to a prince's kingdom, where they live happily ever after.

In some versions of the story, a baby girl's hair magically grows back after a prince touches long golden hair.

Another version of the story ends with the revelation that a baby girl's foster mother had untied a baby girl's hair after a prince leapt from a tower in the middle of the woods, with neither stairs nor a door, and only one room and one window, and long golden hair slipped from a sorceress's hands and landed far below, leaving a sorceress trapped in a tower in the middle of the woods, with neither stairs nor a door, and only one room and one window.
